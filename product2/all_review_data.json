I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot and after reading the reviews I bought these. They have great sound and I haven\u2019t lost any yet although occasionally one falls out when I\u2019m trying to put on my mask. I recommended them to a friend who was going on a trip and didn\u2019t want to take her expensive apple earbuds. She told me they were fantastic. Now I have great sound and don\u2019t worry if I lose one. They are so inexpensive. I can purchase another pair.",

I never have to worry about them running out of power, even during extended use throughout the day.Their compact design makes them incredibly convenient to carry around, fitting snugly in my pocket or gym bag without adding any bulk.Overall, I can't recommend these earbuds enough. They've become an essential part of my daily routine, providing me with unparalleled audio performance and convenience wherever I go.",

        "Body": "I've had these ear buds for a couple of months now and can say that I'm pleased with their performance. I wanted an Air Pod style ear bud but didn't want to pay Air Pod prices. I can't compare these to the aforementioned product, but for my needs these fit the bill.Pairing was simple and automatic (I have an Android phone for reference, Samsung Note 10 to be exact). They connect every time to my phone with no issues.The sound is entirely adequate with the treble and bass both coming through clearly and cleanly. I use these at work (CNC machines) and while working outside around my house cutting grass and using various like tools. I never have a problem hearing my music or the spoken word.Bluetooth connectivity and range is good as well. I walked into a different room with multiple obstacles between the ear buds and my phone and the sound never cut out. Distance apart was about 40 feet. I'm sure I could have gone further. I haven't done a formal test of this as of yet. Usually my phone is clipped to my belt or laying just a few feet away so it doesn't cross my mind to be honest.They fit comfortably in my ears and the included charger keeps them ready to go. I can listen to them for at least two 10 hour days before I plug the charger in, but could go longer if I had to.Overall these are good ear buds for not a lot of money. I read the reviews on these before I purchased them to help me make a decision and I hope my review helps someone else make up their mind.",

        "Body": "It has been difficult for me to find a decent pair of earbuds that doesn't have the over the ear hook, that'll stay in place after wearing for more than hour... Until now!I don't like the over the ear hooks because I wear glasses and the ear piece of my glasses puts pressure on the ear hook and after about an hour, the area behind my ear starts to hurt really bad. I've tried several different kinds of ear buds that are supposed to fit snuggly in the ear and not fall out, but after about 30 min, guess what... They start working their way out! One night, I was at work, wearing one of my earbuds and washing dishes. Before I knew it, the earbud slipped out and fell into the dish water. Thank God they were the water proof kind.A few weeks ago, I saw the T12's and thought, what the hell... They were on sale, so I figured I'd give them a shot. There were a few factors involved with making the decision to get these.1. They were on sale. (Who doesn't like to save money?)2. The battery life they claimed to have. I was skeptical about that. 12 to 14 hours, continuous play? The ones I was wearing have a 4 hour battery life, but had magnetic batteries that I could just change out without having to remove the earbud. The first night at work, I fired up my music at around 5p.m. and listened to it for my entire 9 hour shift and on the drive home. I was immediately impressed!3. Stayed put the entire time! After a little while, I could hardly tell that it was there. While I'm working, I only use the left earbud cause I have a headset on my right ear. No more worries about the earbud working loose and falling into the dish water again! One thing I did change was the earbud tip. I replaced the soft silicone tip with a memory foam cushion tip. They aren't cheap, but they are well worth the money.4. Sounds quality is great! No static in the background and the sound is nice and clear. I can actually hear the lyrics!I told myself that I'd give them 2 weeks of use before deciding that they really were all that, or if I was going to have to go back to my search for the perfect earbuds... Again, if in fact, they even existed! Well, the 2 week  trial period is over, and here I am, doing something that I never do! Writing a review for them!Seriously folks, I highly recommend these earbuds. If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would in a heart beat!One thing I am going to do is order another pair of them, as soon as I'm done with this review, to have as back-ups!",

But it never matters until you actually try them yourself. Everything sounded good but now it was time to see if I wasn't going to be let down as they are only $21 and you know the old saying \"you get what you pay for \".These IMO beat Apple air pods! What I feared proved to be wrong. The sound quality and bass is very good. The functionality and ease of calling, answer phone calls and playing music is of ease. And one of the top reasons for me personally for getting these is the use of Siri.They exceeded my expectations by far! And the fact that it is over 80% cheaper than Apple air pods is insane! I seriously can't believe the quality.This has to be one of my better purchases on Amazon period!  It's a steal!I've told a few people that these are better than Apple air pods, in my opinion of course. And being that I've had a few Apple airpods, I'm more than qualified to have this opinion.This is one of those products that will be very hard to believe for many. But I truly love that fact that when I'm speaking to someone else on the other line, they can hear me clearly. With my Apple air pods, unfortunately after a while that was always an issue. I know many people can vouch for thatAnd what do you have to lose? They're only about 23 dollars.",

Go ALL day on a single charge, playing music and calls. Only complaint I have is they are a little annoying to get out of the case. They fit in super tight and no spot to grab a hold. Other than that. Awesome",

        "Body": "The sound and the bass of this earbud is not bad, and the price is alright too. The only issue is that the stick and the size of earbud is a little bit big. It appears like an AirPod first generation, with the longer stick... so if I use it in casual places, it is ok. In highly competitive environment, such as at work, I probably want to use one that is a smaller size. Because, people say, don't judge a book by its cover, but the reason they say it is that, people always judge you.",

It was stuck at 84 even after charging the case for 10 minutes, and then also after using the earbuds for a while and sticking them back in the case for a bit, still stuck at 84%.",
