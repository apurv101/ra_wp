        "Body": "My favorite section of this book was the author\u2019s acknowledgment of Sy Friend, the retired director of The Variety Club Camp for Handicapped Children in Worchester, Pennsylvania, an apparent beacon of love and humanity in the world.I had known nothing of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, with its Jewish immigrant families in the late twenties and early thirties and its African-Americans who had moved to the northern states from the south.  I learned about tallits, jook joints and the prevalence of dance halls for entertainment during that era prior to the Second World War.  I got an in-depth snapshot into the way people lived and engaged each other in the struggling neighborhood of Chicken Hill. I learned about the informal segregation of class, religious culture and race in small-town Pennsylvania and the ominous presence of the Ku Klux Klan and its annual march that was pretty much tolerated quietly by all.I enjoyed meeting the various primary characters---the heartful Chona, (the pivotal owner of the Heaven and Earth grocery store,) her husband, Moshe, the silent Nate, his loving wife, Addie, the mysterious Bernice, and the deaf boy, Dodo. They were colorful, soulful people, whose lives enriched the satellite community of Chicken Hill.The plotline of the novel was intriguing and satisfyingly redemptive.  Even though the writing itself felt at times cumbersome and verbose, with lengthy, run-on sentences and digressions about minor characters, this was a haunting book.  Speaking to its subtle and not-so-subtle intolerance for \u201cthe other\u201d lacing the streets of America, the small acts of love and courage penetrated deeply into my psyche and are not to be forgotten.",

It is only when the truth about the dead man is discovered and the involvement of the white citizens is revealed that the secret is fully disclosed.A novel full of fascinating characters with equally fascinating (and fitting) names like- Monkey Pants, Dodo and Big Soap. Friendship with the lead female character, Chona, is a prize valued by everyone. Chona inherited the Heaven and Earth Grocery Store from her father.Although there is sadness in the lives of the people of Pottstown and in their struggles to get by, there is also love and humor and camaraderie, as they do what they can to support one another. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

        "Body": "HEAVEN AND EARTH GROCERY STORE gives us a slice of a Jewish/black neighborhood in Pottsfield, Pennsylvania called Chicken Hill.From the title of the novel and the synopsis we expect this to feature a grocery store run by Chona and Moshe Ludlow, but there are numerous other characters who sometimes steal the show. Moshe runs a theater in the neighborhood that often caters to the black element. His right-hand man is Nate Timblin, a black man who seems to be a saint. Nate becomes a central character when a young deaf black boy is sent to a hospital/asylum for something he didn\u2019t do. Chona was assaulted during what appeared to be an epileptic fit by Dr. Roberts who had been rejected by her. Dodo, the black boy, came to her rescue, but her hospitalization and ultimate demise was blamed on Dodo.It was then a veritable phalanx of characters enter the story. There\u2019s Paper a beautiful black woman who functions as a newspaper, hence her nickname. There are Fatty and Big Soap, a black man with a thing for Paper, and his not too bright partner. They plot to get Dodo out of the asylum. Nate is integral in the plan and actually carries it out.But not before the climax of the story when Nate confronts the other villain (besides Dr. Roberts) who is known as \u201cThe Son of Man\u201d at the asylum. He\u2019s an orderly there but no one has the guts to confront this child abuser (Would the whole staff ignore a child abuser?). Poor Dodo is about to become a victim when the action swings in his favor. While at the asylum, Dodo is placed in a bed near a boy with cerebral palsy whom Dodo calls \u201cMonkey Pants\u201d. Monkey Pants can only communicate with one finger, using a form of Morse Code when he \u201ctalks\u201d to Dodo. Author McBride has a facility with these minor characters, Monkey Pants being the most original. Monkey pants also has an original way to deal with TSOM when he tries to assault Dodo. Too original. He can only use one finger.I had a problem with the climax scene. The Egg Man shows up at the hospital to deliver eggs and coffee to his multiple customers at the sprawling institution, only to be confronted by the villain, The Son of Man. They get into a tussle, Nate coming to the rescue as TSOM abuses the Egg Man with a sock loaded with lead. Author McBride needs this guy to be there but there\u2019s no reason for TSOM to be there other than for Nate to rescue The Egg Man and get him to take him to find Dodo. That\u2019s called author intrusion and McBride does it more than once. McBride also needs TSOM to be there to reveal nice guy Nate\u2019s lurid background.",

The book kept me wanting more. This is the best book I have read this year! (I have read 10 at the time of this review).  McBride's ability to weave in mystical magic or folklore spices up his storylines, giving readers the impression that the stories could be true. I have since read another book by McBride,  Deacon King Kong. It too is an awesome read. I will be reading more of McBride's novels",

        "Date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024",
        "Body": "The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store poignant look at relationships, redemption, racism and the American dream. The author, James McBride introduces us to a series of characters living in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas, focusing on the residents of a community called Chicken Hill in the 1930s.  Chicken Hill is home to Pottstown\u2019s Jewish immigrants, Blacks coming from the South during The Great Migration and immigrants from other European countries. The Heaven & Earth grocery store is owned by a Jewish couple, Chona and Moshe and serves the residents of Chicken Hill. The novel is mostly centered around a 12 year old deaf boy named Dodo, but each character introduced (and there are a lot) also has a story. I gave 4.5 stars because the book has a slow start and it is hard to keep the characters straight, but stick with it! As the book progresses and there is an incident involving Dodo, the characters and their stories begin to connect and the result is an emotional, touching, sometimes infuriating, engrossing story. McBride tells the story in an interesting way with complex dialogue and character development through flashbacks and memories that explain how and why they are the way they are as the events with Dodo begin to unfold and every character is involved or becomes involved in some way. I both read and sometimes listened to The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store and enjoyed both.",

        "Body": "James McBride is an accomplished saxophonist/jazz musician. I knew that going into the book. (Oh, digression--did you know that he also played with the band, The Remainders? That\u2019s a band with other writers like Amy Tan, Dave Barry, Barbara Kingsolver, Stephen King, Maya Angelou and several others who played for charity and fundraising). Anyway, I mention his musicianship because I see it all over the pages of The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.This is the first book I\u2019ve read by McBride (definitely more to come), so pardon my schoolgirlish, giggly first crush for the way that his writing lifts me up, how his words and characters opened my heart, only to break it, and then put it back together in a most absolute and tender way. James McBride is a kind, gentle soul, and his writing reflects this\u2014his ability to bring the world together in a novel. He honors humanity. We are all connected, and this author compels that naturally from his characters. Now, how great is that, yeah?I want to put this in your hands and promise you a magnificent reading experience. It starts off in a shaggy dog kind of way, with an ensemble of characters, several who possess whimsical names like Fatty, Big Soap, Monkey Pants, Dodo. And their names fit flawlessly to their nature. The story starts with a 1972 prologue\u2014a human skeleton is found in an old abandoned well, and then the body of the story begins in 1936 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, a place called Chicken Hill, where Jews, immigrants, and Black folks lived side by side, sometimes in harmony, other times in discord, but here\u2019s the thing\u2014the goodness of people, the kindness of their hearts\u2014that is what ultimately rises to the top.For the story to unfold, there has to be some sinister aspects, too\u2014aren\u2019t we still fighting the fight of ignorance, bigotry, corruption, meanness? But, in the McBride world, well, we also follow the long stretch of yarn as it wends around this way and that, through streets and backyards, dirt roads, onto hills and a shul and a church, through tunnels and a dance hall. And The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.I don\u2019t need to rehash the plot, but there are a few fun facts about this book worth mentioning in a review. Such as, there are an abundance of characters introduced early on, and then again later on, before the plot actually launches. That\u2019s the shaggy part. We don\u2019t get to the plot too quickly\u2014instead, Mcbride takes his time, builds the characters. They are already leaping off the pages by the time the plot rolls in.There are subplots, too, but in the end, they all weave their chords and come together. McBride may slow your roll at first, but it\u2019s a winning bonanza of breadth and depth, from the smallest detail to the broadest design. Scenes that seem initially inconsequential become key notes later on.Early on, we meet the arresting Jewess, Chona. Chona is an unforgettable female protagonist\u2014I\u2019m keeping her in my journal of best. female. characters. ever. She is handicapped with a limp\u2014but her limp doesn\u2019t stop her strength of purpose, her fierce dignity, her bounteous benevolence, her gentle grace, and her consummate integrity. You will fall in love with her, just like Moshe, the theater and dance hall owner, did. Moshe and Chona dared to welcome change and inclusivity to their part of the world.At this time, in the 1930s, Black people were almost exclusively cast in menial jobs. But Moshe books Black jazz bands to play at his theater, and successfully includes all tribes together at the dance hall, who \u201cfrolicked and laughed, dancing as if they were birds enjoying flight for the first time.\u201d Chona runs the grocery store, and extends credit to anyone who can\u2019t afford to pay; she rarely keeps a record of their debt. The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store may lose money, but it is rich in goodwill and kindness.Back to this being like a musical book\u2014a jazzy book. Jazz music conjures that raspy, soulful, edgy flavor, blended from a mix of cultures and harmonies. McBride embraces those diverse, insistent, zingy, soul-stirring rhythms and blues into the narrative threads of his novel. I can hear the swing and the chase, the boogie and the blues, the sounds that go everywhere at once and jelly roll the story within a complex set of fusion and feelings. It\u2019s also just a damned good story!The narrative pulls you here and there, up and down, and when you meet Dodo, the sweet and barely teenaged deaf kid, your protective instincts will wrap yourself around him and never want to let him go. And, when Dodo meets Monkey Pants\u2014well, this right there\u2014the heart of the novel that will break you in pieces.At times, I had a wellspring of tears\u2014not just for joy or anguish. Sure, comedy and tragedy fill these pages. But McBride\u2019s natural humanity and gentle nature is the colossal, phenomenal heart of the book. The author steps aside, he doesn\u2019t ever intrude. The core of the narrative are the characters. Their cacophony becomes a coda for living large.This tale made me want to be better, to do better, to open my eyes to all the missed connections, to fix the broken chords and forge new ones, and seek eternally to strengthen them. We are humanity, we are the essential substance to add love to the world, one modest good deed at a time. That is The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.",

It absolutely lives up to all the accolades.Despite \u201cthe skeleton in the well\u201d mentioned in the first line of the book, this isn\u2019t a conventional who-done-it. Yes, the mystery of the skeleton hovers quietly over the story, but it\u2019s largely in the background in a narrative about the difficult lives of a diverse group of small-town, lower-class folks trying to get by. Prejudice and discrimination mix with accommodation and friendship, suspicions and mistrust bump up against shared experience and the best of humanity. And the dialog \u2013 oh the dialog! \u201cSo he balled up his fist\u2026and I mean that white boy reached back and sent that big fist of his rambling through four or five states before it said hello to Fatty.

He liked to part Fatty from this world.\u201d Or this: \u201cBernice had the kind of face that would make a man wire home for money.\u201d And this: \u201c\u2026it\u2019s not technically illegal. But we gotta do it at night.\u201dUltimately this book is an invitation to appreciate the value of empathy and respect. It\u2019s a powerful reminder that we\u2019re all in this together. And yes \u2013 it\u2019s a delight to read.",

        "Body": "In the neighborhood of Chicken Hill, Pottstown, Pennsylvania, in June 1972, police found a skeleton, wearing a gold chain with a mezuzah, at the bottom of a well, next to a lot that had been torn down a day earlier to make way for a new neighborhood. They visited the home of the only Jew left on Chicken Hill, on account of the mezuzah; his home stood on the site that almost half a century earlier had been the local synagogue. Because of this, he was deemed a suspect, though he would never face charges. He skipped town almost immediately, and days later the neighborhood was reduced to rubble by a devastating hurricane.Forty-seven years earlier, in 1925, young theater-manager Moshe Ludlow bet the little money he had saved on hiring a famous musical act to play at his small venue. Jews from all over the Northeast came to dance and frolic. Moshe recovered his investment many times over. He married Chona Yakov, the brilliant daughter of the local rabbi, and settled in Chicken Hill, which was then a vibrant community home to Blacks and Jews. As years went by, most affluent Jews moved downtown. Chona refused to move out. Moshe and Chona owned a two-story building that housed the neighborhood\u2019s only store on the first floor, The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store, and their home on the second floor. The store was a losing business on account of Chona\u2019s kindness, but it was a regular hangout spot and neighbors loved it.Over the next twelve years, Chicken Hill, and the world at large, undergo seismic changes\u2014the local KKK chapter gains popularity, Nazism rises in Europe, and America\u2019s immigrants begin to question their new way of life. Among all these social changes, Chicken Hill\u2019s inhabitants undergo personal upheavals as well, but their sense of community remains strong despite the adversities that come their way.The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store is a novel in three parts and an epilogue, told by an omniscient narrator, about the ups and downs of a community between the years 1925-1936, in an ever-changing world. It touches on several themes, such as racial politics, inequality, sexual violence, disability, sense of community and belonging, friendship, and karmic justice.The first thing that struck me as I settled into the story was McBride\u2019s assured, propulsive, scathing writing. Despite being an ensemble kind of story, each individual character shines thoroughly, so the reader gets to know each character\u2019s motivations, inner life, idiosyncrasies. I haven\u2019t been that crazy about an ensemble cast of characters as I was with these. The curmudgeons in the story are some of the most sympathetic people in it.The Heaven\u2026 is by no means a happy novel; there are weighty issues and sadness overload, but they are treated so compassionately and so beautifully that the reader will root for these underdogs.",

It could have been written by a world reknown comedian plus history teacher, plus a person from the era's witness protection program, if they had one. Amusing, fast and unbelivable quick and witty dialogue; loveable characters strongly drawn. It is possible to have misty eyes on the last page. Don't miss this 5 star book. I found it amazing!",

        "Body": "This is a well written book with a good story . The beginning chapters were rough. They didn't flow well as the cadence was off and therefore the story felt  like it stumbled along . It needed better descriptions of physical characteristics of  the people and places in the novel . It also desperately needed humor.  The book is grimly compelling. There are many profound and memorable moments in this book.1930's America was not the promised land of easy living for immigrants and it still isn't today.The book does a decent job of portraying life for people who are not male WASP in 1930's Pennsylvania.It takes place in a community on the outskirts of the main town. The people of the Hill, who are viewed as \" less than \" by  the mainstream WASP town people, are vibrant and hardworking people who are important to the town even if the town does not acknowledge that.The community on the Hill is diverse. Their are many different types of Jewish people, \"Disabled\" ,Blacks, Germans, Italian , and Latino people living there all tied together by Chona, Moshe, The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store and the Theater.Chona, \"Dodo\", and \" Monkey Pants \" are what keeps the story hopeful and compelling.The book does have the underlying message of \"White Privilege\" makes it almost impossible for anyone other than able bodied male WASP to arrive at their full potential and that  immigrants lives are hard. At times the reader feels like this is just a message on continuous repeat. Although on the surface the message of book is that is that if you are not  Male, White, Anglo Saxon Protestant like the original founders of the United States Constitution life is hard, it is really a book about community and how we can all make life better for one another if we stay united and work together.It's a good \" book club\" read but needs humor.",

        "Date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024",
        "Body": "There are numerous characters in this book, and some of them are the strong ones who drive the story. One bit of advice I have is do not get bogged down trying to keep a list of who everybody is in this 385 (print edition) book because that will ruin the reading experience. Readers will not have any trouble remembering the major important characters of Chicken Hill, a rural area of immigrants - Blacks, Jews from various countries, and poor immigrant Whites. Chona is the polio-crippled daughter of a rabbi whom  Romanian-Jew Moshe finds attractive and full of humor, and it is Chona who runs the Heaven &Earth Grocery Store. Often, she extends credit so that her neighbors can eat, knowing that it is unlikely they can ever repay her in full.This is definitely a character-driven story; many pages are primarily dialogue. This is not a book that everyone will love because it might seem a bit slow in this day and age of thrillers. There are many flawed characters, but the difference between good guys and bad guys is whether a character exhibits any concern for others. (using \"guys\" as a generic human being, as in west coast people who say \"you guys\" meaning persons of any gender being spoken to).  I would say that this is a book about humanity, about the importance of talking to people of other cultures and religions, trying to understand, and- above all- learning to get along for the betterment of our planet.At the end of chapter 7, a 10-year-old Black boy named Dodo is introduced. For me, Dodo's experiences are what made the book a five star. i don't want to say any more, but it is powerful.",

        "Title": "Good read .... until its anticlimactic finish",
        "Date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024",
        "Body": "The writing flowed easily enough, that I was able to finish the book in 4 sittings.  I found myself slowing down my reading in order to keep pace with all the characters introduced in the book.  Perhaps the author might have restructured his storyline so that there were not too many characters, principal and incidental, for the reader to track.  In the end though, the book left significant loose ends about what would have happened next in the lives of the principal characters.  Ultimately, I felt let down as a reader.  It seems that the author wanted to convey that as difficult and fraught life is, there is basic goodness and redemption that sprinkles the person at different points in his/her life.  While the book indeed dwelled on the characters' difficulties and fraught lives, the author (for me) failed to also narrate redemption in its proper context.  There was a summarized, indirect reference to some level of victory in the end, but its emotional impact was far too downplayed to a brief, hurried epilogue. The ending failed to make me smile, which I suspect is what the author would have hoped for his reader.  Because I felt that the author failed to explore (or narrate) what would have happened to the characters after the \"climax\", the book did not give me a sense of closure; the story felt like it was not on balance.  I could not say that this was one of the best books that I have read.  But by no means is this work uninteresting.",
