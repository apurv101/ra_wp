Well, today, I realized I couldn\u2019t remember what in the world I\u2019d done with them after my AirPods died. Hours later, I found them in the bottom of my washing machine. I left them in my pants pocket. I just knew they were ruined. Well, they still work perfectly. Even my husband was amazed. My only complaint about them is I wish I could locate them like my AirPods. I love these and dare I say it? I like them better than my AirPods!! They stay charged for a long time, and charge the same as the Apple ones. I\u2019ve decided I need another pair! \ud83e\udd70",

I have small ear holes or something. The first song I chose to listen to was Bottle and Mary Jane by Jelly Roll. It sounds great! I paid less than $30 and I gotta say they\u2019re worth every penny. I cannot compare them to more expensive buds because I\u2019ve not used them.  But these are perfect for me because I won\u2019t be  using them much. I don\u2019t care about name brands or having the product of the moment. If they don\u2019t last or if I start having issues I will update this, as I just got these 2 days ago.",

The interchangeable ear cups let you customize the fit and the little screen on the case that shows the battery level is nifty--Apple should have this feature. Since you can buy three of these for the cost of only one pair of the basic Airpods--they're awesome. The sound quality is just terrible! I found that changing the EQ settings on my iPhone helps a bit depending on the type of music you are listening to. These don't noise cancel at all.  They feel cheap. The plastic on the case is rough--not smooth like Airpods. The case is flimsy. I'm worried that flipping it open and shut often could lead to it breaking. The earbuds themselves are so light in your hand--very easy to drop. I'm confident these will work great for what I bought them for--listening to music in the gym and podcasts while I'm folding laundry--and I built that assumption into my purchase--I didn't expect great sound. If you're settling in to really listen to music and drown out noise in a coffee shop, these are not for that.",

It was an easy set up with my Samsung s10. I haven't utilized any of the buttons yet. I tried the volume today per the booklet, but was unable to get it to work. I find it easier to use the phone volume button. I don't plan to use these for calls only music. I find the music quality = in both ears. I went out in my backyard and was able to walk freely without losing the connection. I left the phone in the house and was able to get about 25 ft until it wasn't commuicating with the phone. I was digging up some small tree roots and the earpieces remained in except once. It loosened in my ear and when i pressed it back in it stopped the music.

They are comfortable in the ear, and stay in easily.If I could suggest anything, it would be a larger option for the earbud insert. The biggest one in the pack works for me, but I can still feel some wiggle room that perhaps a larger insert would take care of.I will point out these are not meant to eliminate all outside noise, but dampens it down quite a bit. If I have these in while using a lawn mower, I can still hear music but not super clearly. You may want to consider an over the ear headphone if that's the intended use.Overall I am very happy with these and definitely recommend them!",

My ear did get sore where the earbud changes size from small inner ear portion to the larger portion that hangs out of the ear. They tend to build up moisture in the ear canal. Not that it's unbearable but it's a different experience and I'll have to be diligent in keeping the earbuds super clean.The sound is good. They're not completely noise cancelling which is good for my needs. I have not tried them in very noisy environments though.The microphone is good for calls but voice to text seems to have difficulties. It could be an issue with something I'm doing but it's an issue I'm having nonetheless.The battery life is surprisingly good. I like the fact that the battery life is shown on the outer case.

        "Body": "Sometimes I'm amazed by the advancements in wireless and micro technology, especially when it comes to audio. These popped up in an email from Amazon a few days ago. Though I usually ignore those Deal notices this one intrigued me. I have a JBL Everest over-ear headset that I love for indoor phone calls and they're pretty good for music too (though I don't use them that way). I often like to go outside when I'm on the phone and the JBLs aren't convenient to use with a stocking cap, so I'd thought briefly about getting something in-ear to wear under my hat. These were $35 and the reviews were good. I liked that the case wirelessly charges the ear buds, and the case can be charged wirelessly too. My Samsung phone has wireless charging so I already have two wireless chargers and they're very convenient (especially given that the USB port on my phone was getting sketchy). So I figured I'd give them a try. I played a variety of my favorite music. I first asked for Jeff Buckley live music and the first song that started playing as I stepped outside was \"Hallelujah.\" I walked around the property listening to my favorite music and before I knew it I had been listening to music for about three hours. I had really only cared about the sound quality for phone calls and whether they would stay in my ears (which is usually a problem for me). They never came close to falling out and they are comfortable. For phone calls the sound quality is very good on both ends. And though they're rated as having a 33' range I walked all around the house and got considerably farther than that from my phone with two walls separating the devices and I had no dropouts. Overall I am so happy with them that after a week of using them I ordered a backup pair.I have three VERY minor niggles but even combined I wouldn't consider them significant enough to knock off even \u00bd star. First, I had trouble gripping them well enough to get them out of the case quickly when I got an unexpected phone call. I started leaving them on a paper towel on the table next to me, but it now seems I've discovered the right way to grip them. Second, though they have a voice announcement of which side is which when first removed from the case, I was concerned that I might confuse L and R as they don't appear to have any visible indicators. My solution was to use my fine-point permanent marker to write an L on the left one. Third, one of my wireless phone chargers is a tilted stand that holds my phone at a convenient angle. I was unable to get the Ear buds case to wirelessly charge on that one until last night when I accidentally discovered that the problem was that the case was too small to hit the sweet spot on the charger. I solved the problem by boosting the case up with a pad of mini sticky notes (as shown in the photo).EDIT (I apologize if I forget to come back to delete my previous review):None of the above has changed but I forgot to mention that these are NOT good for noise isolation (at least not the way they fit me) but I prefer it that way. I'm a musician and music sounds less natural to me when the surrounding environment is completely eliminated, and I like being able to have a conversation or hear a knock at the door without removing them. Even without a tight seal I never have to reseat them and the sound quality stays consistent (a first for me after trying several other brands).UPDATE: I've been using these ear buds for five weeks now. I use them for hours every day and they continue to impress me. On three occasions only the right channel had a signal when I initially put them in to listen to music, but each time I put them back in the case and took them out again (which turned them off and on) and they worked normally. I've only had this happen with music and only when I first take them out of the case (i.e. it hasn't happened while on a call or after I've been listening to music with both working).",

        "Body": "Good for the price, however there are SOME issues.If you have tiny or sensitive ears, these are not comfortable. I'm unfortunately unable to wear them for periods longer than 40-ish minutes due to how paiful they are to wear. This is just an issue with my ears, but if you are like me and you are determined to get these, wear them upside down. It's significantly less painful.The audio is loud. Even on the lowest setting, these things are pretty loud. I have autism and when im having a sensory overload, the lowest settings of these are very painful. Wholeheartedly recommend using these with an app like spotify where it allows you to lower the volume further via the app.The touch sensors on the side are SO SENSITIVE. My hair manages to trigger them, yet when I actually want to skip a song or pause and play my music, it doesn't work to well and can lead to some frustration.The audio quality itself seems okay. It's definitely not like my more expensive over-the-ear headphones, but it isn't grating or awful. I don't use these for calls,  so I'm not too sure about the mic quality.Battery life is pretty nice, the overall feel of the earbuds in my hands are nice also. The case feels a little cheap on the outside, but not to the point where I feel like the lid is going to break off. Just be careful not to drop them.I like the color and appearance of them! They look exactly like the picture. I haven't had any issues with the case or charging, but please be aware when you first turn it all on, the case battery is going to drop very quickly to charge the headphones.The earbuds come with a lifetime warranty you can activate for free. I reached out to customer support regarding a question, and they replied within the next business day and were very helpful.TL;DR:Hurts tiny ears, loud minimum audio, touch gestures kinda suck... buuutttt audio itself good for the price, the earbuds come with a free lifetime warranty, battery life is nice, they look exactly as advertised, customer service is quick and efficient.Overall 4/5\u2b50\ufe0f",

        "Date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023",
        "Body": "Yes, my subject line sounds like that trash hyperbole you get on annoying pop-up ads on your Smartphone! And ironically, it usually has to do with ear buds. There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.Now, first off, I am just a customer\u2026 never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to \u201cclick on a review\u201d for a discount or whatever. No\u2026 the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I\u2019m really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what \u201cguts\u201d that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex\u2026 nor expensive. How company\u2019s like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!I\u2019ve tried those \u201cRolls Royce\u201d buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.Their Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman\u2019s voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.I\u2019ve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.And a note on their service. I\u2019ve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company\u2019s for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it\u2019s nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.Now, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY\u2026 yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham \u201clifetime warranties\u201d, that corrupt company\u2019s like Hammacher Schlemmer  have.I had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry\u2019s support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good \u2018ol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.A day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience.  The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.So, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on\u2026 and they love them. And none of had any problems.I\u2019m sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I\u2019ve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!Yes, goodness and quality still exist. It\u2019s rare\u2026 but it\u2019s out there!",

I started accidentally abusing them and found out that they are indestructible, and as a nice bonus, they sound nice!I\u2019ve had them for about a year now.\u2022I lost them on the riding lawn mower\u2014they were stuck in a thing on the back that I won\u2019t describe, but they were really hard to get out.\u2022They were in my pocket and went through the washer and dryer, and when they came out, they worked like normal, no difference in sound quality. Just the headphones went through, not the case.\u2022I lose them all the time, either one or the other or the entire case. The battery life is so long that sometimes I can\u2019t find the case for two days but can still use the headphone (s) that I have with me. Also charges fast.Definitely worth buying. Easy to pair to any device as long as they aren\u2019t already paired to something else.",

I cleaned case and earbuds really good but still not working I then dropped the case with earbuds it it then it started to work.  Also for past month even with a full charge, very seldom it would cut off sound quickly.  Last for a couple seconds only. Also my daughter\u2019s one earbud stopped working.

        "Body": "(UPDATE: Right after expressing my concerns with the sound quality, customer service reached out to see how they could help! I added a star because it's REFRESHING when customer service is actually great!)... it's got issues.At the time of writing, I'm writing this review, mostly because this product has SO much promise, but it has two issues that left me disappointed. Also, for preface, I'm a filmmaker who also makes music, so I'd say I have a good ear for sound.First, the good: The build quality is EXCELLENT, especially for the price! It's a bit bigger than some competitors, but it's really light and well-made. The screen is helpful, and the earbuds themselves feel solid. Bluetooth connectivity is straightforward as well!Now, onto my critiques: A smaller one, but still important, but the noise cancelling just doesn't work on this. While it does a good job blocking out sound, I've had friends and family members complain about my microphone when calling. The product actually lists that it has some sort of noise canceling for calls, but it's nothing really special.But that's not my biggest problem.It's just the sound is SO off! Some people might be able to get used to it, but I can't. It was really shocking because the first impressions were great, and I don't get why so many people have reviewed this so positively. As someone who listens to a wide range of music (hip hop, rock, pop, even traditional East Asian music!), the earbuds do a poor job of outputting a clear sound. The mix is REALLY muddy, especially at the low frequencies. Basses really mess up male vocals, and high frequencies are airy. The mids seem completely missing, almost like the inverse of what you'd hear through a phone!If they can just adjust their EQ to sound fuller (and maybe tone down the bass), then these would be INCREDIBLE. Again, I'm SHOCKED that this has as many positive reviews. I'd rather buy $8 wired earbuds over these. This product has HUGE POTENTIAL, but completely WASTED buy the actual sound quality.(And no, I will not be downloading EQ's specifically for these earbuds. I have too many devices)The Tozo T6 (my previous earbuds) are a great alt at this price point (whenever it's on sale at least), but since I wanted to try something new, I'm sticking with the JBL Vibes. They sound great :)",

        "Body": "I originally reviewed these earbuds saying that you couldn't just use one bud without the other one draining it's battery as well, but that's not strictly true (although there is a risk of it).  You need to be mindful not to close it too quickly after taking out the bud you want to use.  As long as you give it a few seconds before closing it, it appears to reliably recharge the other one (it loses a very small amount of power since it was activated upon opening the charger).I didn't have to take this precaution with my old Boltune earbuds, but I couldn't find those online anymore, so I had to try something else (these ones).Aside from the charging issue, which I appear to have resolved, according to people I talk to over the phone, these don't sound as good as my old buds, but people don't seem to have a hard time understanding me.  That said, I don't often hold conversations in loud environments, and so I don't know how well these filter out loud background noise.Still, so far so good.  They're comfortable and they sound pretty good, especially for the price.  In fact, for the price, they're really good.",
