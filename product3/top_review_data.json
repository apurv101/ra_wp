        "Body": "I love this story about the four Padavano sisters and their parents. Rose is the strong willed matriarch of the family. She strongly believes her husband, Charlie, just doesn\u2019t quite measure up to what he could have been. Together, they have four daughters. Readers are drawn right into this story and feel every emotion the characters experience. Julie, the eldest of the four sisters, is a planner, a fixer, a girl who knows what she wants and knows how to get it. She has a plan for her life and it doesn\u2019t include living in a tiny house like where she was raised. Second daughter is quiet Sylvie, a reader who has worked in the public library since she was thirteen and sneaks kisses from the boys behind the shelves knowing she doesn\u2019t want a boyfriend. She doesn\u2019t  take the boys seriously because she is just practicing for her one true love. The twins who are energetic, fun loving girls, round out the Padavano sisters. Then there is William a loner, ignored and never loved at home, socially awkward, always wondering where he fits in, how should he behave, and why he wasn\u2019t enough for his parents. He only feels at home on the basketball court. Julie has decided William is just what she needs to get her life plan started. In alternating chapters, the four main characters tell their story with each chapter bearing the character\u2019s name. Quoting Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry and making comparisons of the four sisters to the sisters in Little Women by Alcott, this book is more than a family saga. This book is a love story. It is about acceptance, heartbreak, forgiveness, and understanding.  Napolitano\u2019s writing is thoughtful and beautiful. The story is deeply moving as each character grows and discover his or her truth and learns how powerful it is to live an authentic life. A five star read and on my list of favorite books in 2024!",

        "Body": "Hello Beautiful by Ann Napolitano, an Oprah's Book Club selection was read by this reviewer as part of a challenge. It would not have been my choice otherwise. As a rule I read to escape and find that many of contemporary bestsellers require me to be too much in the now and too much in my head. So it was no surprise that I struggled to get into this novel. It was too achingly real! The characters, their lives, their dreams and their struggles collided with my own and made me want to withdraw into my own darkness. I so wanted to send this book to the trash bin. Though, as a writer I challenged myself to read other writers ,especially those that are bestsellers. I needed to discover what makes other authors so appealing. How do other writers set-up their stories, build their settings, develop their characters. After a break, I came back to Hello Beautiful and read this as a writer as well as a reader.  By applying a critiquing approach, I was able to achieve a degree of separation from the story. It was just enough to allow me to focus on the cadence of Ann Napolitano's words, to savor the style of her storytelling and to not get caught in my own angst and issues.I began to see how Hello Beautiful shared so many elements with one of my all time favorite books , Little Women. I was intrigued by the depth of personality of each of the sisters Ann Napolitano created. Ann was able to show how each sister was a part of the others yet completely individuals. How they became who they were was beautifully and intricately choreographed by Ann Napolitano throughout the novel. And, adding William a lost soul, an outsider to the mix, was a brilliant catalyst  for  the sisters growth and development!This was NOT an easy book to read. I  took several breaks but always came back.  This poignant story about family love and relationships, did end up stirring my heart and soul in ways, I admit, prefer to avoid.  At times, I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster.  By the time I reached the climax of the story I was fully invested in the characters and their lives, the many highs and lows they experienced and yet were able to weather because they had each other. I don't know how many other of Ann Napolitano's my tortured soul will be able to tolerate. I can say that the beauty of Ann Napolitano carefully crafted words, the images she brought to my mind's eye and the powerful feelings of love that seemed to leap from the pages of Hello Beautiful, eventually brought me to place of peace. I read the last page with a sigh. Then I closed my eyes and reflected on all my best memories of life in a large, obnoxiously in your face , flawed, loving family! All the highs and lows, the good times, the bad and the big loving mess of it all!SIGH.",

        "Date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023",
        "Body": "I bought hardcover & Kindle editions on day of release after seeing Oprah rave about it on CBS. What I appreciate most with Oprah's fiction picks is the selections tend to be a cut above (i.e. more literature) than morning show or other celeb book clubs. (I esp enjoyed Oprah's early picks back in late 90s.) I'm sad to report this was a big miss for me. Having been raised with 4 sisters in blue-collar Chicago, I thought it'd be a slam dunk, but I went from being underwhelmed to disappointed to annoyed. Pains me to write a mediocre review as author likely poured her heart and soul into it, but imo this book needed another year editing and revising, as this just wasn't there yet. A few specifics:* I applaud author for attempting to give characters depth & complexity but she violated basic rule of show, don't tell. Too much of the characters' personalities were explained with excess exposition but not SHOWN to readers through actions or dialogue.* While I don't adhere that authors should write only what they know, it was obvious to me early on the author didn't grow up with sisters, nor grow up or spend years in Pilsen or blue-collar Chicago. Neither felt authentic. Felt more as if author was on outside observing or imagining versus having lived it. I can overlook some tells, but the more those slips/omissions/errors add up, the more a reader loses faith in the entire story.*William's upbringing also didn't ring true. I can understand grief-stricken parents emotionally absent in a child's life, but not to the degree explained (not shown) in the book. More development and examples were needed, as parents cannot simply ignore a child--they still need to nurse, feed, cloth and shelter, etc. It's easy to tell but author needed to again SHOW us how cold parents can be there, but not present.* On plus side, the story & writing comes most alive to me with passages on basketball--the relationships, the tempo, the love of the game, the history. Here's where the author did her homework and really did a nice job translating it, esp to female readership (not to sound sexist, as I'm a woman who played basketball in her youth but still learned a few things or two and appreciated the insights she brought.)I'll leave it there as I don't mean to tear down a book that's not horrible, just not great. Possibly my disappointment is greater than most because I came up with high expectations and this just wasn't credible for me. As other reviewers noted, it's not a bad beach read, but not literature and not Oprah-caliber.  (Sorry for any typos--please don't review my review lol.)",

        "Body": "I can't think of a novel which has so deeply involved me in the lives, experiences and feelings of it's central characters.  I'm quite sad that I've just finished it, because I don't want to say goodbye to William and the close knit family of four sisters he married into.  My own spare childhood resembles William's.  Yet this novel is a way of seeing what it might be like to be raised in an exuberant, complicated, loving family... and how it evolves over time, as each girl becomes her own self... and William comes to realize that he matters.What impresses me most about the writing of Ann Napolitano is her ability to go to the heart of the matter.  She allows us to see the inner lives of her characters, their aspirations, self-doubts, determination, losses and joys.  There is grace here... saving grace.Perhaps I'm particulary drawn to a work like this because, as child psychologist, I've spent years studying how childhood experiences influence who we become, and the healing that is sometimes needed when those experiences have been less than ideal.  Napolitano shows here how it's often the people closest to us, who care about us, who facilitate our healing.  What the author has created here feels firmly based in reality and the challenges human beings face, and, thankfully, she draws these characters to unexpected reconciliation.",

But they are mistaken.His girl tells him they will marry. She tells him he will be a professor. He starts to study. She tells him it's time for a baby. By the time the baby becomes her focus, he realizes he loves her favorite sister. He doesn't want to teach. He wants to work with the basketball team, the only people who ever truly saw him, and cared about him. And because he never knew parental love, he is afraid to be a parent.Read one of the best family stories I've ever enjoyed in Hello Beautiful. See how deftly the author draws her characters and allows you to see them by their actions from several points of view so that you learn their emotions and motivations layer by layer. By the end, you understand and forgive.Forgiveness\u2014and the lack thereof\u2014 is big in this novel. Having been banished by my mother from my family for several years, I was drawn deeply to the mother who stubbornly kept alive her anger against one of her children for so much longer than mine did. The same woman never forgave her husband for not being the man she expected him to be. She never understood that he was so much more.If you had a family, you understand that families\u2014even loving families\u2014are complicated. Families with problems are even more so. Each person adds his or her own characteristics, talents, opinions, and prejudices to a simmering pot of emotions, misunderstandings, and love. With every stir, the recipe can either boil over or settle into what it was meant to be. It's maybe how we get Forrest's box of chocolates\u2014you never know what you're gonna get.Read Hello Beautiful and see that what you thought, or what you were told, or what you expected of someone, is not necessarily the way the story all will turn out. Life is always a surprise at every turn. Why would we expect a book to turn out the way we wish it would? The curveball element makes life\u2014and books\u2014all the more worthwhile.",
