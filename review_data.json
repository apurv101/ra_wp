And then im fighting to keep them in my ear until I find the exact spot they sit comfortaby.And then if im constantly adjusting, my fingers hit the button no matter how i hold the earbuds. And of course when I want them to register my finger input, im pressing 3-4 times for it to notice. And then if im double tapping to skip to the next song, it only registers the first one and then pauses the music.Long story Short,im returning these. If you have a lot of patience, then get these. If not, i recommend getting ones that are smaller/sit in the ear better",

        "Date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2023",
        "Body": "The aesthetic of the earbuds is pretty nice, I enjoy the color and sleekness to it and think its overall visual design isn't bad at all. I especially like how you can see the battery life of the earbuds, which was the feature I was most attracted to, but that's really where my compliments end, and the only reason why I bothered giving an extra star.The earbuds are pretty uncomfortable if you have smaller ears. They feel tight and overly stiff and will make your ears feel on the sore side with extended use. Which is a shame, because again, visually, they look quite nice. They come off quite easily in my experience, so working out and running wouldn't be the best use of these headphones. It doesn't feel secure at all to my ears, but it could also simply be because they don't fit smaller ears in general too well.Secondly, the sound quality isn't very good at all. It sounds muffled and cheap, not something worth around a $30 price point. If you're not someone who cares about sound quality and just want a working pair of wireless earbuds that get the job done though, and you don't mind the muffled-ness, I can see this being a decent pair of headphones for you.Thirdly, I noticed pretty quickly, almost immediately actually, that the battery drains rather quickly. Not even a full 3-5 minutes had passed before it dropped 5%, which may not sound like a lot, but compared to other wireless headphones I've used its rather quick. Even now it's dropped 10% in 10 minutes and I haven't even used/touched it in that time.Overall, I think it's better to find a better pair of earbuds for half the price because there are much better options out there. For the price point, it isn't worth it, and I'm pretty disappointed considering all of the positive reviews.",

        "Body": "I use headphones primarily for audiobooks (and phone calls if someone calls while I\u2019m listening to one). I can\u2019t speak for the call quality because I listened for 2 minutes before deciding to return these. There is an ever-present background noise/static in these earbuds. I have really good hearing (probably to make up for my crappy eyesight lol), so maybe not everyone can hear it, but it is extremely noticeable and distracting to me when listening to audiobooks.As a test, I tried a short YouTube video and didn\u2019t notice it as much (there is constant music/talking in most videos that mostly drowns out the static noise). But for audiobooks where the sound is just one person\u2019s voice+pauses while they narrate, these are not the earbuds for that.My previous earbuds (that had great sound quality for the same price) were broken accidentally and that earbud brand is no longer available on Amazon, so I tried these after reading the good reviews. Bummer that they didn\u2019t work out. My journey to find a suitable replacement continues.Giving the product 2 stars instead of 1 because their warranty is lifetime, even if lost, which I don\u2019t see offered often. Also comes with a (very short) charging cord (my last pair did not come with one) and multiple rubber cone sizes for your ears. The shipping was extremely fast (same day) and the color options are cute. So two stars for those things, but with the sound quality being what it is (on audiobooks especially), I can\u2019t say it \u201cmeets expectations\u201d as one would expect from a 3 star rating.",

I figured if I was going to be doing dumb things like that, I shouldn't be spending $150 on headphones. So I found these which were a bargain at $30.I've been using them for a couple of months now and I've noticed a couple of unusual things:1. Unlike Air Pods, these will not automatically stop playing if you take one of the ear buds out. The Apple ones will automatically pause whatever you are listening to if you take one out. A couple of times these did stop playing when I took them out, but most of the time they don't.2. I've discovered that occasionally, even if I pause what I'm listening to, take the headphones out and put them in their case, sometimes they will begin playing again all on their own, even though they are in the case. I realized that after I went back to pick up where I left off in my audio book and found that it had been playing for more than an hour and I had to go back and figure out where I was in the book.3. Occasionally, not all the time, after I pause what I'm listening to and take the headphones out, the music or audiobook will all of a sudden start up again but play out of my phone speaker, not the headphones. It's a little awkward at work when that happens, especially if I get up from my desk and walk away only to find when I come back that my phone has been playing my audio book out loud the whole time.4. Most annoying of all: Sometimes I will put the headphones on, and it will start playing really loud and will not allow me to turn it down. The headphones will say \"Volume Maximized\" while it's blasting my ear drums. I try to turn it down on my phone and see that the volume goes down, then the headphones bring it back to full volume and again scream at me \"Volume Maximized\". It's awful.The only good thing I can really say about these is that they were cheap. I would not recommend them to anyone now that I've had a chance to use them for a while. I'm probably going to start looking for an alternative.",

I had a pair and after a week of cardio and weights, one ear bud went out in a blaze of glory by the volume shooting up in ear to the max before dying completely. Then, you put it in the case and it becomes a blackhole and sucks the energy out of the case and still doesn't charge. Thought it was a fluke, returned them and started fresh.New day! Similar results... A very annoying thing about these is when you put them in the case, they stay connected to your phone so if you're in the vicinity of your earbuds watching social media videos, they're silent and you don't know why. Then you have to unnecessarily deal with that.My 2nd pair just died and it's outside the return window. We'll see what happens. They're decent if you use them for everyday use and don't sweat in your cubicle. \"Value for the money\" is true.",

About 2 weeks after I began wearing them the right earbud stopped taking a charge, and then stopped working altogether. The left earbud still works but 1) the sound quality is TERRIBLE - there is far too much bass in these. I guess that would be appealing for some types of music but I use them for podcasts and it made it so I couldn't understand so much of what was said. And 2) sometimes it starts turning up the volume for no reason and I can't get it to stop. Fun fact: when it reaches the maximum volume on your device, it starts screaming \"MAXIMUM VOLUME\" into your ear, at maximum volume, over and over and over as if that's any better than just listening to your music or podcast at maximum volume. And it doesn't stop until you turn your volume down, and in my case the earbud would continue to force the volume back up again on its own. I'd have to (in the middle of my shower) disconnect the earbud and reconnect it again in order to make it stop. My guess is that the 2nd earbud will stop working within the next month.",

Well, they fall out of my ears a lot and the \"button\" on the bud to pause/play works when it wants to. I tap it several times and nothing happens, yet other times I barely brush against it and it pauses my music or video. The shape of the bud is awkward and I thought they would be a better pair since they were more expensive, but they really aren't. Not noise cancelling at all either, I can hear all the noises around me when I'm at the gym. Disappointed. The color is cute though, and they sound okay.",

From the moment I got these ear buds, they were glitchy. Since I got them on sale, I figured it's not too bad so I'll just keep them -- especially since I only use them 3x/week for working out.  Big mistake.  The gliches only got worst.  I often struggle to get them to connect properly with Bluetooth.  Then, when it is finally connected and playing, one or both will suddenly cut out. I have to stop my working out to tap at the ear buds, take them out, and/or have to take out my phone and restart the process of trying to connect.  I've only had them 2 months but that means I'm past the 1 month return window.  I'm trashing them and having to spend more money to buy better ear buds.  Don't waste your money like I did.",

        "Body": "I bought these primarily to wear when mowing and when sleeping.  Unfortunately they are borderline loud enough for mowing (battery powered mower) and too loud for sleeping.  I believe someone else mentioned the minimum volume being too loud as well.  The touch controls are inconsistent.  On a positive note they are very comfortable.UPDATE:  TAGRY people are reading these reviews!  I didn't ask for a refund but I received an email today from TAGRY offering a full refund.  I'm not sure I have ever received an unsolicited refund on Amazon before.  Since my initial review I have gotten a better impression of these headphones.  The issue with not being loud enough to hear over my electric lawnmower can be overcome by reseating the buds in my ears as I mow - not a big deal though it does sometimes pause the playback or lower/raise the volume.  I have a pretty bumpy yard and I think the vibration from mowing jars the buds just enough to make the sound almost unhearable.  As regards being too loud for sleep, I'm still working on that solution.  I have also come to appreciated the packaging and design of this product.  One change that would be helpful is for the lid of the holder to have a detent so that it will remain open until the user closes it.  The touch controls were too inconsistent to use anymore (except when I'm not trying to use them), so I just change the volume for the device they are paired with.  Note: I have been diabetic for over 30 years and the pin pricks to my fingers to check my blood sugar (scar tissue) may be the cause of the touch controls not working as well as they might for others.  I'd give these a solid 4 stars now.",

Additionally, I bought some accessories, ear supports to avoid losses due to falls and a case that matches well with the color of the headphones. I put together a complete gift. I thought I had made a good purchase. My great disappointment and annoyance has been seeing how the headphone controls go crazy and the volume goes up and down at will. The touch controls to control the headphones do not work well. It's lucky if they activate the desired function. Don't even think it will control the volume. These headphones do what they want. The battery on the left hearing aid lasts less than half that of the right hearing aid. The headphones turn off when they still have 50 to 60% charge and do not work again until they are over 70-80% charge, and then repeat the same strange phenomenon. Avoid losing your money and investment. Or worse yet, give a gift that won't work. I will return these headphones.Update: September 15, 2023I contacted: Amazon Customer Service, who contacted the manufacturer. The attention was precise and brief. They identified the situation and Tagry almost immediately sent a replacement unit. Thank you so much.This is the type of support and attention that is expected. I congratulate the manufacturer for the excellent willingness to focus on the guarantee of its products. I'm waiting for the new headphones to try them out and see if they work correctly. At the moment a 10/10 to TAGRY and Amazon for the support provided.As soon as I try the new headphones I will gladly update and rerate this review. And I emphasize that no one has asked me to change anything, but if TAGRY deserves 5 stars, I will gladly give it to them.",

I can go a few days without needing to recharge, which is convenient.

The noise cancellation is definitely not comparable to actual AirPod pros not even close but $20 vs. $200+ makes these a keeper. I love these. The battery life is great.

Definitely provides all day constant use if not using as a pair. The are also water resistant to some degree. I dropped them in the tub for 3-5 seconds and haven\u2019t had any issues. For twenty bucks you can\u2019t go wrong.UPDATE:  The charging case quit lighting up 63 days after purchase. Really stinks it\u2019s outside return window.

Anyone with inner ear sensitivities may want to reconsider purchasing. I\u2019ve tried all EQ combos including turning off EQ and toggling the balance between the headphones and nothing works.Secondly, they are uncomfortable. I have small ears and while they come with multiple ear pieces I seem to have gotten two mediums and one large set.Thirdly, I cannot get them to connect with calls\u2014 only music.

I was so badly hoping I wouldn't have that issue with these. I was so wrong. I chose these due to the digital battery indicator and color and the reviews seemed good. I couldn't for the life of me find a list of what materials were used but I got them anyway. When I first got them, they had a strong chemical smell of burning plastic, which worried me but I have been dying for a pair of headphones, especially for the gym and ones that won't break the bank if I don't like them. Putting them in, they're snug, and the sound is good for what you pay for, but vocals sound kind of muffled. I used them after testing on a call with my boyfriend, sounds is pretty good, he even said my voice was pretty clear. But after maybe a couple of hours with the headphones in, I could feel my ears starting to get irritated like they would with the allergic reaction I was having with the Galaxy earbuds. After I ended the call, my ears felt worse so I took them out and all night they were itching, burning, bleeding, and leaking fluid, some yellow, clear, or green. I had to stuff my ears with tissues to get it to calm down. It's now been a week and I've only worn them the day I got them and am trying to let my ears heal. I don't think it's a good idea to try again even if I switch out the ear tips. I'm really sad they broke me out so bad but if you don't have an allergy to any type of material, you might like them.",

They\u2019re not noise cancelling AT ALL. I can literally hear everything with the headphones in,  and on full blast volume. The amount of audio you can hear coming from the headphones when you don\u2019t have them in is like jarring. It\u2019s ridiculous. My ears are really small so I have a hard time finding ear buds that\u2019ll fit my ears, and so I usually buy earbuds with the rubber tips because those always fit my ears so well, I bought these earbuds specifically because of the rubber tips and these will not fit in my ears at all, way too big. And they don\u2019t even provide a smaller fitting ear bud to switch to, all just just bigger size options . And, this last one could just be me, I\u2019ve never had \u201ctouch compatible\u201d ear buds but they\u2019re very annoying. The slightest handing of the headphone causes the song to pause on and off, and the audio is always blasting because I can\u2019t hear anything on such a low volume on these things. I bought these in the hopes they\u2019d be a cheaper alternative to skull candies\u2026never again. I\u2019ll just stick to what I know works for me. So annoyed. So do not but these if:-you enjoy noise canceling headphones/ear buds-you have trouble getting air pods to stay in your ear..there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll get these to stay in there .-you like privacy when you\u2019re listening to whatever you\u2019re listening to. Because these headphones/ear buds, you can literally hear everything coming from them when you don\u2019t have them on.Gonna try to see if my fianc\u00e9 will want to use these cause he doesn\u2019t really care as much as I do, but I will for sure not be using these at all.

        "Body": "I love the look of these earbuds but practically they're really annoying to use. A couple of issues:1- The functionality for skipping, replaying, and turning volume up and down isn't found in a single earbud. When I'm working out or biking I like to only have one earbud in so I can still hear what's going on around me. The right one skips songs and turns volume up, the left one replays and turns volume down, which means unless you're wearing both you don't get the full functionality. My previous wireless earbuds didn't require you to wear both to have full functionality.2- They don't fit well, they're constantly sliding out of my ear, which wouldn't be a big problem except for the next issue.3- They have weird sensitivity to touch. Every time I adjust them in my ear it ends up pausing, no matter how careful I am to only try to grab the stem. On the flip side, when I try to skip songs by tapping the right ear it usually ends up pausing the song. I tested this morning and it takes me, on average, 3 attempts to skip a song.From the pro side, the sound is good, the battery life is great so far, and I love that the case tells you your remaining battery power so I'm not charging the case unnecessarily.UPDATE: on day 32 (convenient 30-day return policy) these broke. They won't hold a charge and just drain the case down to zero. They also make a bizarre buzzing noise and even though my phone says they're connected I can't get any sound and my apps all show a playback error and refuse to play while they're connected.",

The reviews for this product were great and I really wanted to give this product a good rating but I ran into issues that made doing so impossible. Usually, the rubber earbuds come in small, medium, and large size options. Mine only had two pairs of the same size and one larger. Both options are way too large for my ears so the pieces do not rest comfortably or securely. I have never run into a problem like this with similar products and usually use the medium size.The biggest problem, and the DEALBREAKER, is that when I  went to recharge the earphones and the case for the second time... it did not work. I made sure that I used the cord it came with. I made sure the issue was not with the cord itself and that the cord was capable of powering my other electronics. The cord itself worked fine. I'm very disappointed. I will be returning the product shortly. I will get a new set and see if I run into the same problem again. I will update this post afterward.THE PROS: I was very impressed by the sound and the touch-sensitive \"buttons\" that worked very well. If the product was capable of recharging, as it should be, I would have kept it despite not being the most comfortable or secure (due to just how well the sound and buttons/sensors worked).  I have used these many times throughout the past week since I received them. I have had no interference issues and have found that I am able to walk more than 30 feet with no issues of cutting out.UPDATE: I received my replacement order. The earphones work great (as did the previous pair). However, this one is able to hold a charge. Unfortunately, the case will only charge up to 24 percent. I bought one for my son and his has always worked wonderfully. He has never had a problem with charging.",

Sometimes it will be super sensitive to the point where you can brush your finger across the pad (the most easily touched part) while readjusting the earbud and it pauses whatever is being played. Other times you can press on the earbud multiple times at various strengths and directions and it does not recognize the touch. I like to use earbuds to listen to music when working out. I have to regularly readjust these when they get dislodged by sweat, making it easy for me to accidentally touch the earbud control area and stop my music...

They were easy to pair to my phone and stay paired, but one unfortunate downside is that they don't automatically disconnect when you put the earbuds in the case, so in order to play anything out of the phone's speaker, you have to turn your bluetooth off or unpair from the earbuds.My biggest complaint is that even on the lowest setting, they are quite loud. On iPhone, you can manually move the volume bar to between mute and the first \"notch\" of volume (one click up on the volume) in order to get the quietest sound possible, but these headphones don't accommodate that, and just mute when you try to move the volume any lower than the first notch. That being said, the sound didn't bleed, and the quality seemed decent.I didn't find them the most comfortable, but I am also super picky about that, so they should be relatively fine to wear for an hour or two for most people. They have a very long battery life, and the case hasn't dropped below 95% charge in 3 days of use.Lastly, the \"one touch to pause/play\" feature is super finnicky. Whenever I'm adjusting the earbuds in my ear, I always accidentally seem to pause, and when I'm *trying* to pause, it never seems to work! Very frustrating.Overall, besides little issues and the volume, these are nice earbuds, and are exceptionally nice for the price! Would recommend, even though I am going to go for a different option (I'm very sensitive to sound).",

I usually like to use a single earbud, mostly so that I can hear whatever else is going on around me and so that I can essentially double the battery life of the buds by using one and then switching to the other when that first one starts to run out of power.  I thought these ones allowed that, and I could swear that I was able to do that once or twice, but most of the time, it seems that when I open the charger and pull one bud out, the other one remains on, draining its battery.  So, while these aren't bad, and they sound pretty decent, I am rather disappointed that they bud that remains in the charger doesn't turn off.  Not sure why that would be a special feature.  Seems like something most buds should do, but maybe I'm wrong.",

        "Body": "I had high hopes for these earbuds. I read the reviews (always the Most Recent first) and I found many more positive/high-rating reviews than negative/low-rating reviews. After comparing it with other similar products, I decided on the TAGRY X08 Bluetooth Headphones Ture Wireless Earbuds 60H Playback LED Power Display Earphones with Wireless Charging Case IPX5 Waterproof in-Ear Earbuds with Mic for TV Smart Phone Computer Laptop Sports (wow-quite a mouthful for a name). I was excited and hopeful when I hit the \"Place Your Order\" Button. After a quick delivery (PRO), I was soon disappointed with the product.My first major complaint was comfort. I may have smaller than normal ear canals because even with the use of the smallest size ear tips included in the package, I found it difficult to have the earbuds in for long without my ears becoming uncomfortable. When I would wear them, the earbuds would only be in my ears for 30 minutes before I was constantly needing to readjust them to find an angle that was comfortable. The \"Products Description\" and \"Features & Details\" state that the earbuds can be worn comfortably while driving, relaxing, working, or even sleeping. I would NEVER wear these earbuds during ANY of those chill activities. The TAGRY X08 hurt too badly for me to get comfortable enough to relax or do any of those things.The MAIN reason I chose to purchase these earbuds over any others was the COMFORT rating given by Amazon Reviewers. The TAGRY X08 was given an average rating of 4.9\ud83c\udf1f out of 5 for COMFORT. I'm baffled that these earbuds would receive such a favorable rating in this category and would personally score it a 2.5\ud83c\udf1fMy other major complaint was the \"Smart Touch Control\". I have relatively small fingers, which usually allows me to be able to manipulate and access small areas on phones, earbuds, headphones, or other similar products. I had no such luck with the TAGRY X08. When listening to music or a podcast, it was difficult for me to get the timing down for the earbuds to distinguish the difference between \"PLAY/PAUSE\" (one tap) and \"NEXT/PREVIOUS TRACK\" (two taps). Even when I would remove an earbud from my ear, it was still difficult for me to use so I would end up using my phone to skip or pause the song or show.There were a few positive aspects to the TAGRY X08. The earbuds would charge up to 100% pretty quickly after being placed in the case to charge. However, I did notice that the earbuds would run out of juice WAY FASTER than others I've had in the past. As long as I remembered to keep the charging case with me at all times, I would be able to charge the earbuds after the 4/4.5 hours of use. But if I were to leave the house without the charging case (which, unfortunately, did happen a few times) and be gone for 7-9 hours, I would find myself without the use of the earbuds for 5+ hours.The \"One-Step Auto Pairing\" was SUPER convenient and made me very happy each time I would open the case to have the earbuds always connect to my phone. I also enjoyed the light weight of the case and found it easy to hold in my pocket without much thought to it otherwise.Overall, the negatives outweighed the positives for me which is why I returned the TAGRY X08 Earbuds. Thankfully, I selected to have the charge added to my Amazon balance so it was a quick process (PRO).",

        "Body": "Bought these Bluetooth earbuds as well as a pair of Tozo NC2 earbuds. These fit my small ears better (closer to that of Apple AirPod Pros) but my habit of only wearing one earbud at a time isn\u2019t great. These earbuds are not single user friendly because the right earbud won\u2019t function as a single\u2026tapping doesn\u2019t answer calls nor will it function as a play button, however it will pause the music/audiobook. I tend to use only one earbud at a time because of my constant book listening habit when completing mind numbing tasks around the house. I like to always keep one ear vacant for hearing other sounds around me and being able to switch to the other earbud when the 1st one\u2019s battery dies. It\u2019s equally important for me to be able to pause and restart what I\u2019ve been listening to if someone speaks to me or something needs my full attention since I don\u2019t always have a pocket to put my phone in. These don\u2019t allow me to restart listening to my book/music once they\u2019re paused using the right earbud. The left will work fine for this purpose so I\u2019m not sure if I have a faulty set or if they all do this. The sound quality is great but the pass through of ambient sounds around me are more of an annoying whooshing/static noise on top of my music. I prefer to use the noise cancellation feature for that reason. Phone conversations are great using these earbuds and my husband says that it\u2019s easier to hear me using these than my AirPods because these don\u2019t amplify all the sounds around me to hear splitting noise (turning on a water faucet doesn\u2019t drown out my voice nor does the click of my knife on my cutting board). Would I buy these again\u2026possibly but there are so many to choose from in this price range, I\u2019d probably give a different brand a try first.Edit: seller contacted me to assist me with the problems described above and couldn\u2019t resolve the issues. I received another set of earbuds from them free of charge and this pair will function as a pair or single earbud for pause/play of audio listening but will not answer phone calls. The only way I can take calls on the second pair is to answer the call using my phone and switch from phone to the earbuds. I have also discovered that despite removing the earbuds from my ears they do not have the pause detection of Apple that will automatically pause listening when removed. These will continue playing audio until both earbuds are placed into the charging case. This is not a deal breaker but definitely an annoyance if I pause audio, remove them from my ears and inadvertently touch the earbuds and restart audio while handling them (quite easy to do). I am very pleased with this seller and their response to my difficulties with the purchase, but I\u2019m not really impressed with the earbuds. I do continue to use them since I can get around the problems and I hate to toss out a great fitting earbud.",

This being the case, there is a fair amount external noise leakage.  The end that goes into the ear is actually oblong instead of round, so perhaps that is why they don't seal very well. There is also some discomfort after having them in for a while.  Regarding the sound quality, they are a bit too mid-range/boxy sounding.  If sound quality, comfort, and/or noise cancellation are important to you, then I would suggest you look elsewhere and be prepared to pay a bit more....you get what you pay for I suppose.",

        "Body": "Sometimes I'm amazed by the advancements in wireless and micro technology, especially when it comes to audio. These popped up in an email from Amazon a few days ago. Though I usually ignore those Deal notices this one intrigued me. I have a JBL Everest over-ear headset that I love for indoor phone calls and they're pretty good for music too (though I don't use them that way). I often like to go outside when I'm on the phone and the JBLs aren't convenient to use with a stocking cap, so I'd thought briefly about getting something in-ear to wear under my hat. These were $35 and the reviews were good. I liked that the case wirelessly charges the ear buds, and the case can be charged wirelessly too. My Samsung phone has wireless charging so I already have two wireless chargers and they're very convenient (especially given that the USB port on my phone was getting sketchy). So I figured I'd give them a try. I played a variety of my favorite music. I first asked for Jeff Buckley live music and the first song that started playing as I stepped outside was \"Hallelujah.\" I walked around the property listening to my favorite music and before I knew it I had been listening to music for about three hours. I had really only cared about the sound quality for phone calls and whether they would stay in my ears (which is usually a problem for me). They never came close to falling out and they are comfortable. For phone calls the sound quality is very good on both ends. And though they're rated as having a 33' range I walked all around the house and got considerably farther than that from my phone with two walls separating the devices and I had no dropouts. Overall I am so happy with them that after a week of using them I ordered a backup pair.I have three VERY minor niggles but even combined I wouldn't consider them significant enough to knock off even \u00bd star. First, I had trouble gripping them well enough to get them out of the case quickly when I got an unexpected phone call. I started leaving them on a paper towel on the table next to me, but it now seems I've discovered the right way to grip them. Second, though they have a voice announcement of which side is which when first removed from the case, I was concerned that I might confuse L and R as they don't appear to have any visible indicators. My solution was to use my fine-point permanent marker to write an L on the left one. Third, one of my wireless phone chargers is a tilted stand that holds my phone at a convenient angle. I was unable to get the Ear buds case to wirelessly charge on that one until last night when I accidentally discovered that the problem was that the case was too small to hit the sweet spot on the charger. I solved the problem by boosting the case up with a pad of mini sticky notes (as shown in the photo).EDIT (I apologize if I forget to come back to delete my previous review):None of the above has changed but I forgot to mention that these are NOT good for noise isolation (at least not the way they fit me) but I prefer it that way. I'm a musician and music sounds less natural to me when the surrounding environment is completely eliminated, and I like being able to have a conversation or hear a knock at the door without removing them. Even without a tight seal I never have to reseat them and the sound quality stays consistent (a first for me after trying several other brands).UPDATE: I've been using these ear buds for five weeks now. I use them for hours every day and they continue to impress me. On three occasions only the right channel had a signal when I initially put them in to listen to music, but each time I put them back in the case and took them out again (which turned them off and on) and they worked normally. I've only had this happen with music and only when I first take them out of the case (i.e. it hasn't happened while on a call or after I've been listening to music with both working).",

There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.Now, first off, I am just a customer\u2026 never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to \u201cclick on a review\u201d for a discount or whatever. No\u2026 the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I\u2019m really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what \u201cguts\u201d that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex\u2026 nor expensive. How company\u2019s like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!I\u2019ve tried those \u201cRolls Royce\u201d buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.Their Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman\u2019s voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.I\u2019ve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.And a note on their service. I\u2019ve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company\u2019s for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it\u2019s nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.Now, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY\u2026 yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham \u201clifetime warranties\u201d, that corrupt company\u2019s like Hammacher Schlemmer  have.I had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry\u2019s support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good \u2018ol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.A day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience.  The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.So, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on\u2026 and they love them. And none of had any problems.I\u2019m sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I\u2019ve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!Yes, goodness and quality still exist. It\u2019s rare\u2026 but it\u2019s out there!",

Don't hesitate to give them a try!Overall Rating: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

I have small ear holes or something. The first song I chose to listen to was Bottle and Mary Jane by Jelly Roll. It sounds great! I paid less than $30 and I gotta say they\u2019re worth every penny. I cannot compare them to more expensive buds because I\u2019ve not used them.  But these are perfect for me because I won\u2019t be  using them much. I don\u2019t care about name brands or having the product of the moment. If they don\u2019t last or if I start having issues I will update this, as I just got these 2 days ago.",

These fit perfectly in my ears (I have sensitive ears that will ache over an extended period of time of wearing headphones...Not with these!!! ). The sound quality if superb and I don't ever have them turned up full blast as they're really loud. I utilize them to listen to audio books and podcasts for 8 hours at work and they've never died. I use one at a time and I don't even need to switch sides within those 8 hours. I charged the case the day I received them and that was a week and a half ago and I still haven't recharged them. Talking on the phone voice clarity is great and I have had no issues. Connectivity is easy and consistent. These will be my go to!",

The battery life is quite long, and I can get several full recharges out of the case before needing to plug it in. They are comfortable in the ear, and stay in easily.If I could suggest anything, it would be a larger option for the earbud insert. The biggest one in the pack works for me, but I can still feel some wiggle room that perhaps a larger insert would take care of.I will point out these are not meant to eliminate all outside noise, but dampens it down quite a bit. If I have these in while using a lawn mower, I can still hear music but not super clearly. You may want to consider an over the ear headphone if that's the intended use.Overall I am very happy with these and definitely recommend them!",

Here's my personal review:The Good:- Cheap-ish- Easy to setup / first Connect to iPhone 14 proThe Bad:- Sound quality is not good and tinny- As other have mentioned the ear pods will stop playing at the slightest touch- They sometimes wont start playing again without disconnecting and reconnecting- They don't stop auto-play when removed from ears- They wont take an incoming calls (or notify you) when playing music- Case and ear bud design is not intuitive and difficult to grip to remove from case and put back in- The battery charger levels were not accurateI tried to like these for over 3 months, but just gave up and went back to a backup wired iphone headphones due to quality and ease of use. Ive now bought another set of iPhone Gen 2's to replace this and the difference is very noticeable in all aspects. I'll just need to be more careful in the future.All in all you get what you pay for.

I kept opening and closing the case still nothing.  I then removed the earbuds from the case and plugged it back.  It immediately started charging.  It charged up to 100% within a few mins.  I used the earbuds that night and the next morning put the earbuds back into the case to charge.  When I connected them to my phone today, my phone's Bluetooth showed the earbuds charged to 100%.  The case itself is now showing it's charge at 86.  So I plugged it in and tried charging it.  It will not charge now.  It just stays blinking at 86 when you plug it in.  I bought a wireless charger, still will not charge.  I have plugged it into a couple different USB-C chargers, still will not charge.  I removed the earbuds again, still will not charge.I actually spoke to their customer service regarding the issue yesterday of not being able to charge the case unless I remove the earbuds. I'm not sure why they're not understanding me, however, the final response from them said it could've been a misreading on the case.  At that time, I just figured I'd deal with it.  Unfortunately today, I'm not able to charge the case at all.  I did register the earbuds through Tagry online, so I will just contact them and see what the next step is.  I will update the review after I speak to them again.  I originally was going to give these earbuds 1 star, but upgraded to 2 stars because their customer service was really nice and tried really hard to troubleshoot the issue.Also there is zero noise cancellation.  I can't remember if it stated it had noise cancellation or not, but it doesn't.  You can clearly hear everything around you.  I also keep hearing a poping noise when I please the earbud in my ear.  I'm not sure what that it.  The sound is alright.  It's definitely not crystal clear and the bass isn't anything to get excited over.  I have another pair of earbuds from another brand that sounds much better.  These are actually pretty comfortable to wear which is what I wanted.  The battery life is ok I guess.  I used the earbuds to fall asleep in and after a few hours they were down to 68.  I was hoping the battery life would've been better.  At least they didn't die after only a couple of hours.  Honestly you get what you pay for.  I didn't expect anything phenomenal, but I didn't expect to have any charging issues right off the bat.",

Now at the 2 months mark the audio connection is also getting spotty, where the music I'm listening to will cut out for a second here and there.I had a pair of Yeteky \"Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones with Wireless Charging Case 32H\" which were of better sound quality and had better touch button responsiveness, but they hurt my ears. I gave those to my husband and got these instead. These have a better battery life and are way more comfortable for me, but the touch button is hit and miss and I can definitely hear a little sound distortion. If you have bigger ears, maybe go for the other brand I mentioned? But for my ears I'll sacrifice some quality for a cheap alternative that doesn't cause pain.",

Of course when I try adjusting them in my ears they always seem to turn off and when I try to turn them on I end up having to attempt the process a dozen times or more to get them to work.  The sound is comparable to others on the market, nothing exceptional but by no means poor, fair for the price which is why I didn't rate 1 star.  But there should be a clickable button if they can't get their touch button to work better than this.  I've had these for more than a month and waited to review so I could give myself enough time to make sure it wasn't a learning curve too, it wasn't.  There were a few times I got them to work easy, but a majority of the time I end up tinkering with them for a minute or two just to get them to work at all.  Calibration with phone was easy however.  Maybe I just received a defective set.  But I'm already looking for a new set because I can't stand needing to fuss with them as much as I have to just to get them to do what I want.  I'd spend the money on a better set if I were you.",

Well, they worked for a couple weeks and the sound quality was very good, but then the right side ear bud stopped working for some reason.Good thing I kept the box and they come with a lifetime warranty so I contacted the manufacturer. They suggested I clean the charging contacts. That didn't work. I sent them all the info they requested, including a video showing there was no reaction from the case when placing the buds inside or even removing them. That was enough evidence for them to send me a brand new replacement. They even offered color options. Great customer service!!I received my replacement buds fairly quickly. Its been about a month and they just started disconnecting for no reason. I was listening to music yesterday and they just disconnected. I thought that maybe I was too far away from the case so I didn't think much more of it.Well, I was sitting at my desk, just now, listening to music with the case right next to me they just disconnected. The case is 73% charged and the earbuds have been sitting in the case all night. There should be no reason why they would just disconnect.I'm over these earbuds. Too many issues. It's not even worth getting a new pair through the lifetime warranty because the next pair is going to have issues as well.I think I'm going to stay old school and use wired headphones.",

I didn't want to pay that much again when there are so many options, so I tried these. From the first day, I wasn't a fan. They are too big for my ear canals and slowly work their way out as I wear them, meaning I'm constantly having to adjust them. Which is annoying if I'm doing something that prevents me from adjusting (cooking) and means that they shut off the second I touch them, requiring me to restart whatever I'm listening to. Which is crazy because sometimes when they fall out/I take them out, they keep playing even though they're no longer in my ears. I don't get it. Worse is that they are super sensitive to wind. I like to walk outside to get in my steps, and if it's at all windy, they cut in and out the entire time. So much that there have been a couple times they've gotten out of synch and I'm listening to my audiobook in stereo. It's awful. I wore them on the airplane on the way back from vacation hoping I could get some sleep, and my ears hurt so bad by the time we landed that for the next flight I just took out my corded ear phones.I've only had them for a little over two weeks and I've already ordered a different pair because I hate these so much.The only good thing? One worked its way out of my ear while I was cleaning my pool and fell in, and it took me a few minutes to find it. It still works! Which is insane. So they're waterproof and maybe if you have bigger ear canals and don't want to walk in the wind they'll be okay, but for me, these did not work at all.",

These are the pros, however the cons certainly outweigh them.In terms of UI, the touch-control doesn\u2019t seem to have any sense of designation - meaning that if you brush against the earbuds, readjust them, or even simply hold them to converse with somebody - they will acknowledge this as an attempt to either change song, adjust volume, start/stop music, etc.This isn\u2019t the crux of the issue, though.The key issue with these earbuds is the charging case malfunctioning. Maybe I have a defective set, maybe it\u2019s an industry setting fault. When you place the earbuds into the charging case it charges the ear pieces (hence the name, obviously), and it displays for the user when one bud is finished charging. Sounds great and would be a fantastic tool, and it worked as described for the initial 3 months; however, after this period the right earbud seems to need continuous charging. I\u2019ll see it displayed on the exterior of the charging case and it will continue to do so until the case itself is out of power, at which point it is more or less defunct. This issue takes about 12-24hours to drain the battery. Now, this is not a huge problem given the time frame, but I have to keep it on the charger at all times, which defeats the purpose of the charging case.I have tried everything from cleaning both the earbuds and the case, thoroughly, adjusting the metallic charging prongs to ensure one is not jammed, etc., but all to no avail.Good product, but certainly better products out there. Should mine simply be defective, then I would rate this a 4 star product given the UI issues.",

I'm unfortunately unable to wear them for periods longer than 40-ish minutes due to how paiful they are to wear. This is just an issue with my ears, but if you are like me and you are determined to get these, wear them upside down. It's significantly less painful.The audio is loud. Even on the lowest setting, these things are pretty loud. I have autism and when im having a sensory overload, the lowest settings of these are very painful. Wholeheartedly recommend using these with an app like spotify where it allows you to lower the volume further via the app.The touch sensors on the side are SO SENSITIVE. My hair manages to trigger them, yet when I actually want to skip a song or pause and play my music, it doesn't work to well and can lead to some frustration.The audio quality itself seems okay. It's definitely not like my more expensive over-the-ear headphones, but it isn't grating or awful. I don't use these for calls,  so I'm not too sure about the mic quality.Battery life is pretty nice, the overall feel of the earbuds in my hands are nice also. The case feels a little cheap on the outside, but not to the point where I feel like the lid is going to break off. Just be careful not to drop them.I like the color and appearance of them! They look exactly like the picture. I haven't had any issues with the case or charging, but please be aware when you first turn it all on, the case battery is going to drop very quickly to charge the headphones.The earbuds come with a lifetime warranty you can activate for free.

        "Body": "(UPDATE: Right after expressing my concerns with the sound quality, customer service reached out to see how they could help! I added a star because it's REFRESHING when customer service is actually great!)... it's got issues.At the time of writing, I'm writing this review, mostly because this product has SO much promise, but it has two issues that left me disappointed. Also, for preface, I'm a filmmaker who also makes music, so I'd say I have a good ear for sound.First, the good: The build quality is EXCELLENT, especially for the price! It's a bit bigger than some competitors, but it's really light and well-made. The screen is helpful, and the earbuds themselves feel solid. Bluetooth connectivity is straightforward as well!Now, onto my critiques: A smaller one, but still important, but the noise cancelling just doesn't work on this. While it does a good job blocking out sound, I've had friends and family members complain about my microphone when calling. The product actually lists that it has some sort of noise canceling for calls, but it's nothing really special.But that's not my biggest problem.It's just the sound is SO off! Some people might be able to get used to it, but I can't. It was really shocking because the first impressions were great, and I don't get why so many people have reviewed this so positively. As someone who listens to a wide range of music (hip hop, rock, pop, even traditional East Asian music!), the earbuds do a poor job of outputting a clear sound. The mix is REALLY muddy, especially at the low frequencies. Basses really mess up male vocals, and high frequencies are airy. The mids seem completely missing, almost like the inverse of what you'd hear through a phone!If they can just adjust their EQ to sound fuller (and maybe tone down the bass), then these would be INCREDIBLE. Again, I'm SHOCKED that this has as many positive reviews. I'd rather buy $8 wired earbuds over these. This product has HUGE POTENTIAL, but completely WASTED buy the actual sound quality.(And no, I will not be downloading EQ's specifically for these earbuds. I have too many devices)The Tozo T6 (my previous earbuds) are a great alt at this price point (whenever it's on sale at least), but since I wanted to try something new, I'm sticking with the JBL Vibes. They sound great :)",

        "Body": "For $35? These are incredible. I'm planning on buying 2 or 3 more to give as gifts. The interchangeable ear cups let you customize the fit and the little screen on the case that shows the battery level is nifty--Apple should have this feature. Since you can buy three of these for the cost of only one pair of the basic Airpods--they're awesome. The sound quality is just terrible! I found that changing the EQ settings on my iPhone helps a bit depending on the type of music you are listening to. These don't noise cancel at all.  They feel cheap. The plastic on the case is rough--not smooth like Airpods. The case is flimsy. I'm worried that flipping it open and shut often could lead to it breaking. The earbuds themselves are so light in your hand--very easy to drop. I'm confident these will work great for what I bought them for--listening to music in the gym and podcasts while I'm folding laundry--and I built that assumption into my purchase--I didn't expect great sound. If you're settling in to really listen to music and drown out noise in a coffee shop, these are not for that.",

        "Body": "I ordered these earphones yesterday after I spent some time reading the reviews. I was a bit scepitable due to the price and some of the reviews. They were delivered the same day I ordered them. I opened the box to find them 100% charged! I put them in my ears fit was great and I can walk and move without them falling out of my ears. It was an easy set up with my Samsung s10. I haven't utilized any of the buttons yet. I tried the volume today per the booklet, but was unable to get it to work. I find it easier to use the phone volume button. I don't plan to use these for calls only music. I find the music quality = in both ears. I went out in my backyard and was able to walk freely without losing the connection. I left the phone in the house and was able to get about 25 ft until it wasn't commuicating with the phone. I was digging up some small tree roots and the earpieces remained in except once. It loosened in my ear and when i pressed it back in it stopped the music. Me not wanting to figit with the button to figure it out I chose to walk to my phone. In the coming days I will explore the buttons, but not today.",

Idk radioactive rabbits or something. They charge super fast and the charge lasts around at least 7 business days.But also, they are truly truly water proof. How do I know? Because I\u2019m a mom of a nasty lil 9yo and a potty training 2yo and LAUNDRY is taking over my house. I pretty much just load up the forklift, drop the clothes in, and have a fun lil scavenger hunt after the clothes come out. These sweet lil headphones didn\u2019t deserve to go through the washer with my kids crap stains and half eaten suckers, but they did. And they came out of the washer as if they hadn\u2019t just been traumatized.Props.",

        "Body": "The earbuds were delivered quickly in a nice box, reminiscent of Apple packaging. The instructions were straightforward and concise. The earbuds fit very well into a nice carrying case that includes a battery indicator for the case as well as indicators that the earbuds are charging. The case has kept a good charge and has only been charged once since I got them. However, I only use the earbuds for a short time every day at this point.The only problem I have with the earbuds is that it\u2019s difficult to determine where exactly to tap to change volume, track, answer my phone, etc. I think that will work itself out as I use them more.",

        "Body": "Moved on to these after old airpods not keeping charge. They're a lot bigger. They tend to fall out of my ears when I talk, bend down, chew or move rapidly. When I adjust the placement while wearing them they turn off the audio or switch tracks, but I cannot seem to get the hang of changing tracks or turning off the audio etc while they're in. My ear did get sore where the earbud changes size from small inner ear portion to the larger portion that hangs out of the ear. They tend to build up moisture in the ear canal. Not that it's unbearable but it's a different experience and I'll have to be diligent in keeping the earbuds super clean.The sound is good. They're not completely noise cancelling which is good for my needs. I have not tried them in very noisy environments though.The microphone is good for calls but voice to text seems to have difficulties. It could be an issue with something I'm doing but it's an issue I'm having nonetheless.The battery life is surprisingly good. I like the fact that the battery life is shown on the outer case. No guessing when you might need to charge it.The case is a bit bigger than I expected but it's easier to find when it wants to fall to the bottom of a bag or backpack.",

My Anker Soundcore X10 are my go-to @ $70.  But these TAGRY earbuds are half the price, connect easy, have a long charge, and DON'T fall out of my ears.  If I could give a star rating for \"fit\" it would be a 5.  Make no mistake, this set does not have active noise cancelling or really dynamic clear sound.  They work and they stay in my ear at the gym.  Great find at this price point.",

When comparing to the Apple Airpods, however, the only drawback is that after wearing them for over an hour, they are not as comfortable as the Airpods.  There is an indescribable comfort with the Apple Airpods - you almost forget you're wearing them.  I've tried several different sizes of the silicone caps, however, no matter the size - over time, they are not comfortable.",

My headphones hurt my ears, so I wanted something small that would be more comfortable to sleep. I disliked that these were way too loud on the lowest setting. The volume on the lowest setting is like a medium setting.They are comfortable and I decided to use them for walking in my neighborhood instead. They block out car noise, so I am able to still use them. I got them on sale around Christmas. I like the pink color. The battery life is good, about 6 hours, then you can put them back in the rechargeable case and get several more 6 HR charges from one charge from the case. I think around 40 to 60 hrs in total. Would recommend if you don't mind loud ear buds.",
