But ti really wasnt worth it for me.They stay in my ears until i laugh, chew, or im doing a workout. And then im fighting to keep them in my ear until I find the exact spot they sit comfortaby.And then if im constantly adjusting, my fingers hit the button no matter how i hold the earbuds. And of course when I want them to register my finger input, im pressing 3-4 times for it to notice. And then if im double tapping to skip to the next song, it only registers the first one and then pauses the music.Long story Short,im returning these. If you have a lot of patience, then get these. If not, i recommend getting ones that are smaller/sit in the ear better","2",""

I've tried all 3 sizes provided (horribly smashed, btw) and all 3 cause extreme pain. I've had to use a pair from an old set which provides slight comfort but only for a limited time. I cannot wear these for more than 10 mins without extreme ear pain. It feels like there's a plastic seam that just rubs the inside of the ear and it hurts! If I can't figure out a solution, I will have to return these. Very disappointed üòû","2",""
"product1","all review","3","Mikaela","2.0 out of 5 stars","Not as very good as the reviews made them out to be","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2023","The aesthetic of the earbuds is pretty nice, I enjoy the color and sleekness to it and think its overall visual design isn't bad at all. I especially like how you can see the battery life of the earbuds, which was the feature I was most attracted to, but that's really where my compliments end, and the only reason why I bothered giving an extra star.The earbuds are pretty uncomfortable if you have smaller ears. They feel tight and overly stiff and will make your ears feel on the sore side with extended use. Which is a shame, because again, visually, they look quite nice. They come off quite easily in my experience, so working out and running wouldn't be the best use of these headphones. It doesn't feel secure at all to my ears, but it could also simply be because they don't fit smaller ears in general too well.Secondly, the sound quality isn't very good at all. It sounds muffled and cheap, not something worth around a $30 price point. If you're not someone who cares about sound quality and just want a working pair of wireless earbuds that get the job done though, and you don't mind the muffled-ness, I can see this being a decent pair of headphones for you.Thirdly, I noticed pretty quickly, almost immediately actually, that the battery drains rather quickly. Not even a full 3-5 minutes had passed before it dropped 5%, which may not sound like a lot, but compared to other wireless headphones I've used its rather quick. Even now it's dropped 10% in 10 minutes and I haven't even used/touched it in that time.Overall, I think it's better to find a better pair of earbuds for half the price because there are much better options out there. For the price point, it isn't worth it, and I'm pretty disappointed considering all of the positive reviews.","2",""

On phone calls, no one could understand me because the microphone volume would go in and out.  Even wearing a properly fitted rubber tip, they don't stay in your ears.

"product1","all review","5","AmazonReviewer","2.0 out of 5 stars","Not good for audiobooks","Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2023","I use headphones primarily for audiobooks (and phone calls if someone calls while I‚Äôm listening to one). I can‚Äôt speak for the call quality because I listened for 2 minutes before deciding to return these. There is an ever-present background noise/static in these earbuds. I have really good hearing (probably to make up for my crappy eyesight lol), so maybe not everyone can hear it, but it is extremely noticeable and distracting to me when listening to audiobooks.As a test, I tried a short YouTube video and didn‚Äôt notice it as much (there is constant music/talking in most videos that mostly drowns out the static noise). But for audiobooks where the sound is just one person‚Äôs voice+pauses while they narrate, these are not the earbuds for that.My previous earbuds (that had great sound quality for the same price) were broken accidentally and that earbud brand is no longer available on Amazon, so I tried these after reading the good reviews. Bummer that they didn‚Äôt work out. My journey to find a suitable replacement continues.Giving the product 2 stars instead of 1 because their warranty is lifetime, even if lost, which I don‚Äôt see offered often. Also comes with a (very short) charging cord (my last pair did not come with one) and multiple rubber cone sizes for your ears. The shipping was extremely fast (same day) and the color options are cute. So two stars for those things, but with the sound quality being what it is (on audiobooks especially), I can‚Äôt say it ‚Äúmeets expectations‚Äù as one would expect from a 3 star rating.","2",""

They didn't fit in my ears nearly as well as I'd hoped. The buttons on the side for pausing/unpausing were awkward to use from a lack of a physical button and a solid 2.5 second delay between input and response.

I can easily take calls on my phone, or my computer. Listen to music while I'm out and about. I fly a lot for work and these earbuds are comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have super small ears. Even with the smallest silicone inserts, they get pushed out of my ears after about 45 minutes of use. For longer durations, I just use my over-the-head headphones which I prefer anyway. But these are wonderful!","4",""

They're always loud. Even on the lowest volume setting I can have them on before they stop playing audio altogether (until I turn the sound back up)2. I wish there were left-right indicators on the earbuds themselves. I'm kinda dumb and can't really tell which earbud is supposed to go in which ear until I actually put them in.3. (Not really an issue but it's still something I'd like to talk about): the touch controls are definitely something to get used to. One thing I've also noticed is that you can only use the earbuds to adjust the volume of there's any media playing. Otherwise it won't work at all.4. The earbud case battery also drains a bit too quickly for comfort. Other than that, everything's fine so far.","4",""

"product1","all review","30","Katie","2.0 out of 5 stars","These work, but a couple of things you should know...","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2022","I bought these after dropping my Apple Air Pods in a bowl of marinade (FYI - They are not oil proof). I figured if I was going to be doing dumb things like that, I shouldn't be spending $150 on headphones. So I found these which were a bargain at $30.I've been using them for a couple of months now and I've noticed a couple of unusual things:1. Unlike Air Pods, these will not automatically stop playing if you take one of the ear buds out. The Apple ones will automatically pause whatever you are listening to if you take one out. A couple of times these did stop playing when I took them out, but most of the time they don't.2. I've discovered that occasionally, even if I pause what I'm listening to, take the headphones out and put them in their case, sometimes they will begin playing again all on their own, even though they are in the case. I realized that after I went back to pick up where I left off in my audio book and found that it had been playing for more than an hour and I had to go back and figure out where I was in the book.3. Occasionally, not all the time, after I pause what I'm listening to and take the headphones out, the music or audiobook will all of a sudden start up again but play out of my phone speaker, not the headphones. It's a little awkward at work when that happens, especially if I get up from my desk and walk away only to find when I come back that my phone has been playing my audio book out loud the whole time.4. Most annoying of all: Sometimes I will put the headphones on, and it will start playing really loud and will not allow me to turn it down. The headphones will say ""Volume Maximized"" while it's blasting my ear drums. I try to turn it down on my phone and see that the volume goes down, then the headphones bring it back to full volume and again scream at me ""Volume Maximized"". It's awful.The only good thing I can really say about these is that they were cheap. I would not recommend them to anyone now that I've had a chance to use them for a while. I'm probably going to start looking for an alternative.","2",""

If you are too, try something else. I had a pair and after a week of cardio and weights, one ear bud went out in a blaze of glory by the volume shooting up in ear to the max before dying completely. Then, you put it in the case and it becomes a blackhole and sucks the energy out of the case and still doesn't charge. Thought it was a fluke, returned them and started fresh.New day! Similar results... A very annoying thing about these is when you put them in the case, they stay connected to your phone so if you're in the vicinity of your earbuds watching social media videos, they're silent and you don't know why. Then you have to unnecessarily deal with that.My 2nd pair just died and it's outside the return window. We'll see what happens.

About 2 weeks after I began wearing them the right earbud stopped taking a charge, and then stopped working altogether. The left earbud still works but 1) the sound quality is TERRIBLE - there is far too much bass in these. I guess that would be appealing for some types of music but I use them for podcasts and it made it so I couldn't understand so much of what was said. And 2) sometimes it starts turning up the volume for no reason and I can't get it to stop. Fun fact: when it reaches the maximum volume on your device, it starts screaming ""MAXIMUM VOLUME"" into your ear, at maximum volume, over and over and over as if that's any better than just listening to your music or podcast at maximum volume. And it doesn't stop until you turn your volume down, and in my case the earbud would continue to force the volume back up again on its own. I'd have to (in the middle of my shower) disconnect the earbud and reconnect it again in order to make it stop. My guess is that the 2nd earbud will stop working within the next month.","2",""

I used them for the first time on a 5 hour flight and they worked perfectly-- I could still hear the airplane noise a little, but it cut out the majority of outside sounds.The problems came after my trip, when I tried to put the earbuds to charge for my next flight. I put each earbud into the proper slot, and the case registered that they were charging. Great! But when I put them on the next day, I was disappointed to see that I could only use them for about 5 minutes before they disconnected themselves from my Bluetooth and died.Since that point, I have tried a million different ways to charge these stupid things. I've jiggled them to make sure that the contacts are connecting. I've tried the case both on and off the charger. I've cleaned the contacts (with a dry, clean cloth only!) on both the earbuds and the case. This product is clearly defective-- or perhaps was never intended to work for more than a single use.

Unfortunately they are borderline loud enough for mowing (battery powered mower) and too loud for sleeping.  I believe someone else mentioned the minimum volume being too loud as well.  The touch controls are inconsistent.  On a positive note they are very comfortable.UPDATE:  TAGRY people are reading these reviews!  I didn't ask for a refund but I received an email today from TAGRY offering a full refund.  I'm not sure I have ever received an unsolicited refund on Amazon before.  Since my initial review I have gotten a better impression of these headphones.  The issue with not being loud enough to hear over my electric lawnmower can be overcome by reseating the buds in my ears as I mow - not a big deal though it does sometimes pause the playback or lower/raise the volume.  I have a pretty bumpy yard and I think the vibration from mowing jars the buds just enough to make the sound almost unhearable.  As regards being too loud for sleep, I'm still working on that solution.  I have also come to appreciated the packaging and design of this product.  One change that would be helpful is for the lid of the holder to have a detent so that it will remain open until the user closes it.  The touch controls were too inconsistent to use anymore (except when I'm not trying to use them), so I just change the volume for the device they are paired with.  Note: I have been diabetic for over 30 years and the pin pricks to my fingers to check my blood sugar (scar tissue) may be the cause of the touch controls not working as well as they might for others.  I'd give these a solid 4 stars now.","3",""

Additionally, I bought some accessories, ear supports to avoid losses due to falls and a case that matches well with the color of the headphones. I put together a complete gift. I thought I had made a good purchase. My great disappointment and annoyance has been seeing how the headphone controls go crazy and the volume goes up and down at will. The touch controls to control the headphones do not work well. It's lucky if they activate the desired function. Don't even think it will control the volume. These headphones do what they want. The battery on the left hearing aid lasts less than half that of the right hearing aid. The headphones turn off when they still have 50 to 60% charge and do not work again until they are over 70-80% charge, and then repeat the same strange phenomenon. Avoid losing your money and investment. Or worse yet, give a gift that won't work. I will return these headphones.Update: September 15, 2023I contacted: Amazon Customer Service, who contacted the manufacturer. The attention was precise and brief. They identified the situation and Tagry almost immediately sent a replacement unit. Thank you so much.This is the type of support and attention that is expected.

I like the sound that I receive from these but there are a few problems. Based on the video (both sets are in their cases), for some reason one charges but not the other one in the set. And its not a case issue because I've switched earbuds to that case and then that earpiece will charge. I have to keep taking it out and putting it back in for it to work. I have 2 and they often randomly just switch to the other set even though it will be in its case.  So I'm always scrambling during calls or media play to disconnect the one that's connecting even though I'm not using it. They're constantly falling out of my ears have no noise canceling feature because people complain about the background sounds. It will randomly just turn all the way up and say ""maximum volume"" and wont allow me to adjust it. I have to put them in the case then take them out again for this to stop. And finally, the slighest brush against it will stop the playback at times but then other times when I'm trying to stop/pause - it either won't or it'll advance to the next song.

I was so badly hoping I wouldn't have that issue with these. I was so wrong. I chose these due to the digital battery indicator and color and the reviews seemed good. I couldn't for the life of me find a list of what materials were used but I got them anyway. When I first got them, they had a strong chemical smell of burning plastic, which worried me but I have been dying for a pair of headphones, especially for the gym and ones that won't break the bank if I don't like them. Putting them in, they're snug, and the sound is good for what you pay for, but vocals sound kind of muffled. I used them after testing on a call with my boyfriend, sounds is pretty good, he even said my voice was pretty clear. But after maybe a couple of hours with the headphones in, I could feel my ears starting to get irritated like they would with the allergic reaction I was having with the Galaxy earbuds. After I ended the call, my ears felt worse so I took them out and all night they were itching, burning, bleeding, and leaking fluid, some yellow, clear, or green. I had to stuff my ears with tissues to get it to calm down. It's now been a week and I've only worn them the day I got them and am trying to let my ears heal. I don't think it's a good idea to try again even if I switch out the ear tips.

Idk what everyone was talking about when they ‚Äúloved‚Äù these. They‚Äôre not noise cancelling AT ALL. I can literally hear everything with the headphones in,  and on full blast volume. The amount of audio you can hear coming from the headphones when you don‚Äôt have them in is like jarring. It‚Äôs ridiculous. My ears are really small so I have a hard time finding ear buds that‚Äôll fit my ears, and so I usually buy earbuds with the rubber tips because those always fit my ears so well, I bought these earbuds specifically because of the rubber tips and these will not fit in my ears at all, way too big. And they don‚Äôt even provide a smaller fitting ear bud to switch to, all just just bigger size options . And, this last one could just be me, I‚Äôve never had ‚Äútouch compatible‚Äù ear buds but they‚Äôre very annoying. The slightest handing of the headphone causes the song to pause on and off, and the audio is always blasting because I can‚Äôt hear anything on such a low volume on these things. I bought these in the hopes they‚Äôd be a cheaper alternative to skull candies‚Ä¶never again. I‚Äôll just stick to what I know works for me. So annoyed.

A couple of issues:1- The functionality for skipping, replaying, and turning volume up and down isn't found in a single earbud. When I'm working out or biking I like to only have one earbud in so I can still hear what's going on around me. The right one skips songs and turns volume up, the left one replays and turns volume down, which means unless you're wearing both you don't get the full functionality. My previous wireless earbuds didn't require you to wear both to have full functionality.2- They don't fit well, they're constantly sliding out of my ear, which wouldn't be a big problem except for the next issue.3- They have weird sensitivity to touch. Every time I adjust them in my ear it ends up pausing, no matter how careful I am to only try to grab the stem. On the flip side, when I try to skip songs by tapping the right ear it usually ends up pausing the song. I tested this morning and it takes me, on average, 3 attempts to skip a song.From the pro side, the sound is good, the battery life is great so far, and I love that the case tells you your remaining battery power so I'm not charging the case unnecessarily.UPDATE: on day 32 (convenient 30-day return policy) these broke. They won't hold a charge and just drain the case down to zero. They also make a bizarre buzzing noise and even though my phone says they're connected I can't get any sound and my apps all show a playback error and refuse to play while they're connected.","1",""

The reviews for this product were great and I really wanted to give this product a good rating but I ran into issues that made doing so impossible. Usually, the rubber earbuds come in small, medium, and large size options. Mine only had two pairs of the same size and one larger. Both options are way too large for my ears so the pieces do not rest comfortably or securely. I have never run into a problem like this with similar products and usually use the medium size.The biggest problem, and the DEALBREAKER, is that when I  went to recharge the earphones and the case for the second time... it did not work. I made sure that I used the cord it came with. I made sure the issue was not with the cord itself and that the cord was capable of powering my other electronics. The cord itself worked fine. I'm very disappointed. I will be returning the product shortly. I will get a new set and see if I run into the same problem again. I will update this post afterward.THE PROS: I was very impressed by the sound and the touch-sensitive ""buttons"" that worked very well. If the product was capable of recharging, as it should be, I would have kept it despite not being the most comfortable or secure (due to just how well the sound and buttons/sensors worked).  I have used these many times throughout the past week since I received them. I have had no interference issues and have found that I am able to walk more than 30 feet with no issues of cutting out.UPDATE: I received my replacement order. The earphones work great (as did the previous pair). However, this one is able to hold a charge. Unfortunately, the case will only charge up to 24 percent. I bought one for my son and his has always worked wonderfully. He has never had a problem with charging.","1",""

Sometimes it will be super sensitive to the point where you can brush your finger across the pad (the most easily touched part) while readjusting the earbud and it pauses whatever is being played. Other times you can press on the earbud multiple times at various strengths and directions and it does not recognize the touch. I like to use earbuds to listen to music when working out. I have to regularly readjust these when they get dislodged by sweat, making it easy for me to accidentally touch the earbud control area and stop my music...

They were easy to pair to my phone and stay paired, but one unfortunate downside is that they don't automatically disconnect when you put the earbuds in the case, so in order to play anything out of the phone's speaker, you have to turn your bluetooth off or unpair from the earbuds.My biggest complaint is that even on the lowest setting, they are quite loud. On iPhone, you can manually move the volume bar to between mute and the first ""notch"" of volume (one click up on the volume) in order to get the quietest sound possible, but these headphones don't accommodate that, and just mute when you try to move the volume any lower than the first notch. That being said, the sound didn't bleed, and the quality seemed decent.I didn't find them the most comfortable, but I am also super picky about that, so they should be relatively fine to wear for an hour or two for most people. They have a very long battery life, and the case hasn't dropped below 95% charge in 3 days of use.Lastly, the ""one touch to pause/play"" feature is super finnicky. Whenever I'm adjusting the earbuds in my ear, I always accidentally seem to pause, and when I'm *trying* to pause, it never seems to work! Very frustrating.Overall, besides little issues and the volume, these are nice earbuds, and are exceptionally nice for the price! Would recommend, even though I am going to go for a different option (I'm very sensitive to sound).","3",""

I usually like to use a single earbud, mostly so that I can hear whatever else is going on around me and so that I can essentially double the battery life of the buds by using one and then switching to the other when that first one starts to run out of power.  I thought these ones allowed that, and I could swear that I was able to do that once or twice, but most of the time, it seems that when I open the charger and pull one bud out, the other one remains on, draining its battery.  So, while these aren't bad, and they sound pretty decent, I am rather disappointed that they bud that remains in the charger doesn't turn off.  Not sure why that would be a special feature.

I read the reviews (always the Most Recent first) and I found many more positive/high-rating reviews than negative/low-rating reviews. After comparing it with other similar products, I decided on the TAGRY X08 Bluetooth Headphones Ture Wireless Earbuds 60H Playback LED Power Display Earphones with Wireless Charging Case IPX5 Waterproof in-Ear Earbuds with Mic for TV Smart Phone Computer Laptop Sports (wow-quite a mouthful for a name). I was excited and hopeful when I hit the ""Place Your Order"" Button. After a quick delivery (PRO), I was soon disappointed with the product.My first major complaint was comfort. I may have smaller than normal ear canals because even with the use of the smallest size ear tips included in the package, I found it difficult to have the earbuds in for long without my ears becoming uncomfortable. When I would wear them, the earbuds would only be in my ears for 30 minutes before I was constantly needing to readjust them to find an angle that was comfortable. The ""Products Description"" and ""Features & Details"" state that the earbuds can be worn comfortably while driving, relaxing, working, or even sleeping. I would NEVER wear these earbuds during ANY of those chill activities. The TAGRY X08 hurt too badly for me to get comfortable enough to relax or do any of those things.The MAIN reason I chose to purchase these earbuds over any others was the COMFORT rating given by Amazon Reviewers. The TAGRY X08 was given an average rating of 4.9üåü out of 5 for COMFORT. I'm baffled that these earbuds would receive such a favorable rating in this category and would personally score it a 2.5üåüMy other major complaint was the ""Smart Touch Control"". I have relatively small fingers, which usually allows me to be able to manipulate and access small areas on phones, earbuds, headphones, or other similar products. I had no such luck with the TAGRY X08. When listening to music or a podcast, it was difficult for me to get the timing down for the earbuds to distinguish the difference between ""PLAY/PAUSE"" (one tap) and ""NEXT/PREVIOUS TRACK"" (two taps). Even when I would remove an earbud from my ear, it was still difficult for me to use so I would end up using my phone to skip or pause the song or show.There were a few positive aspects to the TAGRY X08. The earbuds would charge up to 100% pretty quickly after being placed in the case to charge. However, I did notice that the earbuds would run out of juice WAY FASTER than others I've had in the past. As long as I remembered to keep the charging case with me at all times, I would be able to charge the earbuds after the 4/4.5 hours of use. But if I were to leave the house without the charging case (which, unfortunately, did happen a few times) and be gone for 7-9 hours, I would find myself without the use of the earbuds for 5+ hours.The ""One-Step Auto Pairing"" was SUPER convenient and made me very happy each time I would open the case to have the earbuds always connect to my phone. I also enjoyed the light weight of the case and found it easy to hold in my pocket without much thought to it otherwise.Overall, the negatives outweighed the positives for me which is why I returned the TAGRY X08 Earbuds. Thankfully, I selected to have the charge added to my Amazon balance so it was a quick process (PRO).","3",""

These fit my small ears better (closer to that of Apple AirPod Pros) but my habit of only wearing one earbud at a time isn‚Äôt great. These earbuds are not single user friendly because the right earbud won‚Äôt function as a single‚Ä¶tapping doesn‚Äôt answer calls nor will it function as a play button, however it will pause the music/audiobook. I tend to use only one earbud at a time because of my constant book listening habit when completing mind numbing tasks around the house. I like to always keep one ear vacant for hearing other sounds around me and being able to switch to the other earbud when the 1st one‚Äôs battery dies. It‚Äôs equally important for me to be able to pause and restart what I‚Äôve been listening to if someone speaks to me or something needs my full attention since I don‚Äôt always have a pocket to put my phone in. These don‚Äôt allow me to restart listening to my book/music once they‚Äôre paused using the right earbud. The left will work fine for this purpose so I‚Äôm not sure if I have a faulty set or if they all do this. The sound quality is great but the pass through of ambient sounds around me are more of an annoying whooshing/static noise on top of my music. I prefer to use the noise cancellation feature for that reason. Phone conversations are great using these earbuds and my husband says that it‚Äôs easier to hear me using these than my AirPods because these don‚Äôt amplify all the sounds around me to hear splitting noise (turning on a water faucet doesn‚Äôt drown out my voice nor does the click of my knife on my cutting board). Would I buy these again‚Ä¶possibly but there are so many to choose from in this price range, I‚Äôd probably give a different brand a try first.Edit: seller contacted me to assist me with the problems described above and couldn‚Äôt resolve the issues. I received another set of earbuds from them free of charge and this pair will function as a pair or single earbud for pause/play of audio listening but will not answer phone calls. The only way I can take calls on the second pair is to answer the call using my phone and switch from phone to the earbuds. I have also discovered that despite removing the earbuds from my ears they do not have the pause detection of Apple that will automatically pause listening when removed. These will continue playing audio until both earbuds are placed into the charging case. This is not a deal breaker but definitely an annoyance if I pause audio, remove them from my ears and inadvertently touch the earbuds and restart audio while handling them (quite easy to do). I am very pleased with this seller and their response to my difficulties with the purchase, but I‚Äôm not really impressed with the earbuds. I do continue to use them since I can get around the problems and I hate to toss out a great fitting earbud.","3",""

This being the case, there is a fair amount external noise leakage.  The end that goes into the ear is actually oblong instead of round, so perhaps that is why they don't seal very well. There is also some discomfort after having them in for a while.  Regarding the sound quality, they are a bit too mid-range/boxy sounding.  If sound quality, comfort, and/or noise cancellation are important to you, then I would suggest you look elsewhere and be prepared to pay a bit more....you get what you pay for I suppose.","3",""

But I did get what I paid for. The sound quality is not too bad, but the headphones fall out of my ears whenever I bend or lean over--and sometimes even when I'm not bending. And if I accidentally bump them--even lightly, the music pauses--which is annoying because it happens a lot. They will also continue to play when I take them out--they don't automatically stop. So, if you aren't too bothered by that kind of thing, then these are fine. But if you have the $$ to spend on something nicer--then do it.","3",""

"product1","all review","121","thirst4music","5.0 out of 5 stars","Great value for both phone calls and music","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2023","Sometimes I'm amazed by the advancements in wireless and micro technology, especially when it comes to audio. These popped up in an email from Amazon a few days ago. Though I usually ignore those Deal notices this one intrigued me. I have a JBL Everest over-ear headset that I love for indoor phone calls and they're pretty good for music too (though I don't use them that way). I often like to go outside when I'm on the phone and the JBLs aren't convenient to use with a stocking cap, so I'd thought briefly about getting something in-ear to wear under my hat. These were $35 and the reviews were good. I liked that the case wirelessly charges the ear buds, and the case can be charged wirelessly too. My Samsung phone has wireless charging so I already have two wireless chargers and they're very convenient (especially given that the USB port on my phone was getting sketchy). So I figured I'd give them a try. I played a variety of my favorite music. I first asked for Jeff Buckley live music and the first song that started playing as I stepped outside was ""Hallelujah."" I walked around the property listening to my favorite music and before I knew it I had been listening to music for about three hours. I had really only cared about the sound quality for phone calls and whether they would stay in my ears (which is usually a problem for me). They never came close to falling out and they are comfortable. For phone calls the sound quality is very good on both ends. And though they're rated as having a 33' range I walked all around the house and got considerably farther than that from my phone with two walls separating the devices and I had no dropouts. Overall I am so happy with them that after a week of using them I ordered a backup pair.I have three VERY minor niggles but even combined I wouldn't consider them significant enough to knock off even ¬Ω star. First, I had trouble gripping them well enough to get them out of the case quickly when I got an unexpected phone call. I started leaving them on a paper towel on the table next to me, but it now seems I've discovered the right way to grip them. Second, though they have a voice announcement of which side is which when first removed from the case, I was concerned that I might confuse L and R as they don't appear to have any visible indicators. My solution was to use my fine-point permanent marker to write an L on the left one. Third, one of my wireless phone chargers is a tilted stand that holds my phone at a convenient angle. I was unable to get the Ear buds case to wirelessly charge on that one until last night when I accidentally discovered that the problem was that the case was too small to hit the sweet spot on the charger. I solved the problem by boosting the case up with a pad of mini sticky notes (as shown in the photo).EDIT (I apologize if I forget to come back to delete my previous review):None of the above has changed but I forgot to mention that these are NOT good for noise isolation (at least not the way they fit me) but I prefer it that way. I'm a musician and music sounds less natural to me when the surrounding environment is completely eliminated, and I like being able to have a conversation or hear a knock at the door without removing them. Even without a tight seal I never have to reseat them and the sound quality stays consistent (a first for me after trying several other brands).UPDATE: I've been using these ear buds for five weeks now. I use them for hours every day and they continue to impress me. On three occasions only the right channel had a signal when I initially put them in to listen to music, but each time I put them back in the case and took them out again (which turned them off and on) and they worked normally. I've only had this happen with music and only when I first take them out of the case (i.e. it hasn't happened while on a call or after I've been listening to music with both working).","5","61fvUKyPotL._SY88.jpg"

And ironically, it usually has to do with ear buds. There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.Now, first off, I am just a customer‚Ä¶ never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to ‚Äúclick on a review‚Äù for a discount or whatever. No‚Ä¶ the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I‚Äôm really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what ‚Äúguts‚Äù that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex‚Ä¶ nor expensive. How company‚Äôs like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!I‚Äôve tried those ‚ÄúRolls Royce‚Äù buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.Their Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman‚Äôs voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.I‚Äôve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.And a note on their service. I‚Äôve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company‚Äôs for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it‚Äôs nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.Now, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY‚Ä¶ yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham ‚Äúlifetime warranties‚Äù, that corrupt company‚Äôs like Hammacher Schlemmer  have.I had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry‚Äôs support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good ‚Äòol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.A day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience.  The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.So, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on‚Ä¶ and they love them. And none of had any problems.I‚Äôm sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I‚Äôve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!Yes, goodness and quality still exist. It‚Äôs rare‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs out there!","5",""

So far my experience has lived up to those reviews. I'm pretty impressed with the sound quality of these earbuds. The battery life is quite long, and I can get several full recharges out of the case before needing to plug it in. They are comfortable in the ear, and stay in easily.If I could suggest anything, it would be a larger option for the earbud insert. The biggest one in the pack works for me, but I can still feel some wiggle room that perhaps a larger insert would take care of.I will point out these are not meant to eliminate all outside noise, but dampens it down quite a bit. If I have these in while using a lawn mower, I can still hear music but not super clearly. You may want to consider an over the ear headphone if that's the intended use.Overall I am very happy with these and definitely recommend them!","5",""

I plugged it into the charging cable that was included and it would not charge.  It stayed at 91 for several mins.  I kept opening and closing the case still nothing.  I then removed the earbuds from the case and plugged it back.  It immediately started charging.  It charged up to 100% within a few mins.  I used the earbuds that night and the next morning put the earbuds back into the case to charge.  When I connected them to my phone today, my phone's Bluetooth showed the earbuds charged to 100%.  The case itself is now showing it's charge at 86.  So I plugged it in and tried charging it.  It will not charge now.  It just stays blinking at 86 when you plug it in.  I bought a wireless charger, still will not charge.  I have plugged it into a couple different USB-C chargers, still will not charge.  I removed the earbuds again, still will not charge.I actually spoke to their customer service regarding the issue yesterday of not being able to charge the case unless I remove the earbuds. I'm not sure why they're not understanding me, however, the final response from them said it could've been a misreading on the case.  At that time, I just figured I'd deal with it.  Unfortunately today, I'm not able to charge the case at all.  I did register the earbuds through Tagry online, so I will just contact them and see what the next step is.  I will update the review after I speak to them again.  I originally was going to give these earbuds 1 star, but upgraded to 2 stars because their customer service was really nice and tried really hard to troubleshoot the issue.Also there is zero noise cancellation.  I can't remember if it stated it had noise cancellation or not, but it doesn't.  You can clearly hear everything around you.  I also keep hearing a poping noise when I please the earbud in my ear.  I'm not sure what that it.  The sound is alright.  It's definitely not crystal clear and the bass isn't anything to get excited over.  I have another pair of earbuds from another brand that sounds much better.  These are actually pretty comfortable to wear which is what I wanted.  The battery life is ok I guess.  I used the earbuds to fall asleep in and after a few hours they were down to 68.  I was hoping the battery life would've been better.  At least they didn't die after only a couple of hours.  Honestly you get what you pay for.  I didn't expect anything phenomenal, but I didn't expect to have any charging issues right off the bat.","2",""

For being a well reviewed item I would've thought it would be much easier to control the functions.  There's no easy way to adjust volume or turn off/on.  Of course when I try adjusting them in my ears they always seem to turn off and when I try to turn them on I end up having to attempt the process a dozen times or more to get them to work.  The sound is comparable to others on the market, nothing exceptional but by no means poor, fair for the price which is why I didn't rate 1 star.  But there should be a clickable button if they can't get their touch button to work better than this.  I've had these for more than a month and waited to review so I could give myself enough time to make sure it wasn't a learning curve too, it wasn't.  There were a few times I got them to work easy, but a majority of the time I end up tinkering with them for a minute or two just to get them to work at all.  Calibration with phone was easy however.  Maybe I just received a defective set.  But I'm already looking for a new set because I can't stand needing to fuss with them as much as I have to just to get them to do what I want.

They suggested I clean the charging contacts. That didn't work. I sent them all the info they requested, including a video showing there was no reaction from the case when placing the buds inside or even removing them. That was enough evidence for them to send me a brand new replacement. They even offered color options. Great customer service!!I received my replacement buds fairly quickly. Its been about a month and they just started disconnecting for no reason. I was listening to music yesterday and they just disconnected. I thought that maybe I was too far away from the case so I didn't think much more of it.Well, I was sitting at my desk, just now, listening to music with the case right next to me they just disconnected. The case is 73% charged and the earbuds have been sitting in the case all night. There should be no reason why they would just disconnect.I'm over these earbuds. Too many issues. It's not even worth getting a new pair through the lifetime warranty because the next pair is going to have issues as well.I think I'm going to stay old school and use wired headphones.","2",""

I didn't want to pay that much again when there are so many options, so I tried these. From the first day, I wasn't a fan. They are too big for my ear canals and slowly work their way out as I wear them, meaning I'm constantly having to adjust them. Which is annoying if I'm doing something that prevents me from adjusting (cooking) and means that they shut off the second I touch them, requiring me to restart whatever I'm listening to. Which is crazy because sometimes when they fall out/I take them out, they keep playing even though they're no longer in my ears. I don't get it. Worse is that they are super sensitive to wind. I like to walk outside to get in my steps, and if it's at all windy, they cut in and out the entire time. So much that there have been a couple times they've gotten out of synch and I'm listening to my audiobook in stereo. It's awful. I wore them on the airplane on the way back from vacation hoping I could get some sleep, and my ears hurt so bad by the time we landed that for the next flight I just took out my corded ear phones.I've only had them for a little over two weeks and I've already ordered a different pair because I hate these so much.The only good thing? One worked its way out of my ear while I was cleaning my pool and fell in, and it took me a few minutes to find it. It still works! Which is insane. So they're waterproof and maybe if you have bigger ear canals and don't want to walk in the wind they'll be okay, but for me, these did not work at all.","2",""
"product1","all review","138","Cameron Baird","2.0 out of 5 stars","Great for about 3 months","Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2023","First and foremost, these earbuds have great audio quality and resonance, as well as sound buffering to neutralize outside noise. These are the pros, however the cons certainly outweigh them.In terms of UI, the touch-control doesn‚Äôt seem to have any sense of designation - meaning that if you brush against the earbuds, readjust them, or even simply hold them to converse with somebody - they will acknowledge this as an attempt to either change song, adjust volume, start/stop music, etc.This isn‚Äôt the crux of the issue, though.The key issue with these earbuds is the charging case malfunctioning. Maybe I have a defective set, maybe it‚Äôs an industry setting fault. When you place the earbuds into the charging case it charges the ear pieces (hence the name, obviously), and it displays for the user when one bud is finished charging. Sounds great and would be a fantastic tool, and it worked as described for the initial 3 months; however, after this period the right earbud seems to need continuous charging. I‚Äôll see it displayed on the exterior of the charging case and it will continue to do so until the case itself is out of power, at which point it is more or less defunct. This issue takes about 12-24hours to drain the battery. Now, this is not a huge problem given the time frame, but I have to keep it on the charger at all times, which defeats the purpose of the charging case.I have tried everything from cleaning both the earbuds and the case, thoroughly, adjusting the metallic charging prongs to ensure one is not jammed, etc., but all to no avail.Good product, but certainly better products out there. Should mine simply be defective, then I would rate this a 4 star product given the UI issues.","2",""

When the battery ran down quickly, I found my original earbuds and processed a return. I was given the option to get a new pair or a refund, and decided that maybe the new pair would work better.The reviews I had read boasted that the battery life for this model was long and that they also had q good and clear mouthpiece. I recieved this pair yesterday and waited until this morning to open the package and make sure I charged them and the battery pack before I used them. The battery pack went from ‚Äú100%‚Äù to ‚Äú70%‚Äù and then back up to ‚Äú100%‚Äù as it was connected to a power source. I took the earbuds out and carried them around the house for the day, but only used them for a couple of phone calls. Then, this evening I put them on to listen to an audiobook. About 30 minutes in, the prompt ‚ÄúThe battery needs to be charged‚Äù started and repeated itself in a couple of minutes. I'm sending this set back as well. Disappointing!","2",""

I'm unfortunately unable to wear them for periods longer than 40-ish minutes due to how paiful they are to wear. This is just an issue with my ears, but if you are like me and you are determined to get these, wear them upside down. It's significantly less painful.The audio is loud. Even on the lowest setting, these things are pretty loud. I have autism and when im having a sensory overload, the lowest settings of these are very painful. Wholeheartedly recommend using these with an app like spotify where it allows you to lower the volume further via the app.The touch sensors on the side are SO SENSITIVE. My hair manages to trigger them, yet when I actually want to skip a song or pause and play my music, it doesn't work to well and can lead to some frustration.The audio quality itself seems okay. It's definitely not like my more expensive over-the-ear headphones, but it isn't grating or awful. I don't use these for calls,  so I'm not too sure about the mic quality.Battery life is pretty nice, the overall feel of the earbuds in my hands are nice also. The case feels a little cheap on the outside, but not to the point where I feel like the lid is going to break off. Just be careful not to drop them.I like the color and appearance of them! They look exactly like the picture. I haven't had any issues with the case or charging, but please be aware when you first turn it all on, the case battery is going to drop very quickly to charge the headphones.The earbuds come with a lifetime warranty you can activate for free. I reached out to customer support regarding a question, and they replied within the next business day and were very helpful.TL;DR:Hurts tiny ears, loud minimum audio, touch gestures kinda suck... buuutttt audio itself good for the price, the earbuds come with a free lifetime warranty, battery life is nice, they look exactly as advertised, customer service is quick and efficient.Overall 4/5‚≠êÔ∏è","4",""

(UPDATED: Excellent Customer Service!)","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2024","(UPDATE: Right after expressing my concerns with the sound quality, customer service reached out to see how they could help! I added a star because it's REFRESHING when customer service is actually great!)... it's got issues.At the time of writing, I'm writing this review, mostly because this product has SO much promise, but it has two issues that left me disappointed. Also, for preface, I'm a filmmaker who also makes music, so I'd say I have a good ear for sound.First, the good: The build quality is EXCELLENT, especially for the price! It's a bit bigger than some competitors, but it's really light and well-made. The screen is helpful, and the earbuds themselves feel solid. Bluetooth connectivity is straightforward as well!Now, onto my critiques: A smaller one, but still important, but the noise cancelling just doesn't work on this. While it does a good job blocking out sound, I've had friends and family members complain about my microphone when calling. The product actually lists that it has some sort of noise canceling for calls, but it's nothing really special.But that's not my biggest problem.It's just the sound is SO off! Some people might be able to get used to it, but I can't. It was really shocking because the first impressions were great, and I don't get why so many people have reviewed this so positively. As someone who listens to a wide range of music (hip hop, rock, pop, even traditional East Asian music!), the earbuds do a poor job of outputting a clear sound. The mix is REALLY muddy, especially at the low frequencies. Basses really mess up male vocals, and high frequencies are airy. The mids seem completely missing, almost like the inverse of what you'd hear through a phone!If they can just adjust their EQ to sound fuller (and maybe tone down the bass), then these would be INCREDIBLE. Again, I'm SHOCKED that this has as many positive reviews. I'd rather buy $8 wired earbuds over these. This product has HUGE POTENTIAL, but completely WASTED buy the actual sound quality.(And no, I will not be downloading EQ's specifically for these earbuds. I have too many devices)The Tozo T6 (my previous earbuds) are a great alt at this price point (whenever it's on sale at least), but since I wanted to try something new, I'm sticking with the JBL Vibes. They sound great :)","4",""

The interchangeable ear cups let you customize the fit and the little screen on the case that shows the battery level is nifty--Apple should have this feature.

I found that changing the EQ settings on my iPhone helps a bit depending on the type of music you are listening to. These don't noise cancel at all.  They feel cheap. The plastic on the case is rough--not smooth like Airpods. The case is flimsy. I'm worried that flipping it open and shut often could lead to it breaking. The earbuds themselves are so light in your hand--very easy to drop. I'm confident these will work great for what I bought them for--listening to music in the gym and podcasts while I'm folding laundry--and I built that assumption into my purchase--I didn't expect great sound.

Good sound and battery life","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024","Moved on to these after old airpods not keeping charge. They're a lot bigger. They tend to fall out of my ears when I talk, bend down, chew or move rapidly. When I adjust the placement while wearing them they turn off the audio or switch tracks, but I cannot seem to get the hang of changing tracks or turning off the audio etc while they're in. My ear did get sore where the earbud changes size from small inner ear portion to the larger portion that hangs out of the ear. They tend to build up moisture in the ear canal. Not that it's unbearable but it's a different experience and I'll have to be diligent in keeping the earbuds super clean.The sound is good. They're not completely noise cancelling which is good for my needs. I have not tried them in very noisy environments though.The microphone is good for calls but voice to text seems to have difficulties. It could be an issue with something I'm doing but it's an issue I'm having nonetheless.The battery life is surprisingly good. I like the fact that the battery life is shown on the outer case. No guessing when you might need to charge it.The case is a bit bigger than I expected but it's easier to find when it wants to fall to the bottom of a bag or backpack.","4",""

However, I only use the earbuds for a short time every day at this point.The only problem I have with the earbuds is that it‚Äôs difficult to determine where exactly to tap to change volume, track, answer my phone, etc. I think that will work itself out as I use them more.","4",""

Good sound and battery life","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024","Moved on to these after old airpods not keeping charge. They're a lot bigger. They tend to fall out of my ears when I talk, bend down, chew or move rapidly. When I adjust the placement while wearing them they turn off the audio or switch tracks, but I cannot seem to get the hang of changing tracks or turning off the audio etc while they're in. My ear did get sore where the earbud changes size from small inner ear portion to the larger portion that hangs out of the ear. They tend to build up moisture in the ear canal. Not that it's unbearable but it's a different experience and I'll have to be diligent in keeping the earbuds super clean.The sound is good. They're not completely noise cancelling which is good for my needs. I have not tried them in very noisy environments though.The microphone is good for calls but voice to text seems to have difficulties. It could be an issue with something I'm doing but it's an issue I'm having nonetheless.The battery life is surprisingly good. I like the fact that the battery life is shown on the outer case. No guessing when you might need to charge it.The case is a bit bigger than I expected but it's easier to find when it wants to fall to the bottom of a bag or backpack.","4",""

"product1","top review","20","thirst4music","5.0 out of 5 stars","Great value for both phone calls and music","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2023","Sometimes I'm amazed by the advancements in wireless and micro technology, especially when it comes to audio. These popped up in an email from Amazon a few days ago. Though I usually ignore those Deal notices this one intrigued me. I have a JBL Everest over-ear headset that I love for indoor phone calls and they're pretty good for music too (though I don't use them that way). I often like to go outside when I'm on the phone and the JBLs aren't convenient to use with a stocking cap, so I'd thought briefly about getting something in-ear to wear under my hat. These were $35 and the reviews were good. I liked that the case wirelessly charges the ear buds, and the case can be charged wirelessly too. My Samsung phone has wireless charging so I already have two wireless chargers and they're very convenient (especially given that the USB port on my phone was getting sketchy). So I figured I'd give them a try. I played a variety of my favorite music. I first asked for Jeff Buckley live music and the first song that started playing as I stepped outside was ""Hallelujah."" I walked around the property listening to my favorite music and before I knew it I had been listening to music for about three hours. I had really only cared about the sound quality for phone calls and whether they would stay in my ears (which is usually a problem for me). They never came close to falling out and they are comfortable. For phone calls the sound quality is very good on both ends. And though they're rated as having a 33' range I walked all around the house and got considerably farther than that from my phone with two walls separating the devices and I had no dropouts. Overall I am so happy with them that after a week of using them I ordered a backup pair.I have three VERY minor niggles but even combined I wouldn't consider them significant enough to knock off even ¬Ω star. First, I had trouble gripping them well enough to get them out of the case quickly when I got an unexpected phone call. I started leaving them on a paper towel on the table next to me, but it now seems I've discovered the right way to grip them. Second, though they have a voice announcement of which side is which when first removed from the case, I was concerned that I might confuse L and R as they don't appear to have any visible indicators. My solution was to use my fine-point permanent marker to write an L on the left one. Third, one of my wireless phone chargers is a tilted stand that holds my phone at a convenient angle. I was unable to get the Ear buds case to wirelessly charge on that one until last night when I accidentally discovered that the problem was that the case was too small to hit the sweet spot on the charger. I solved the problem by boosting the case up with a pad of mini sticky notes (as shown in the photo).EDIT (I apologize if I forget to come back to delete my previous review):None of the above has changed but I forgot to mention that these are NOT good for noise isolation (at least not the way they fit me) but I prefer it that way. I'm a musician and music sounds less natural to me when the surrounding environment is completely eliminated, and I like being able to have a conversation or hear a knock at the door without removing them. Even without a tight seal I never have to reseat them and the sound quality stays consistent (a first for me after trying several other brands).UPDATE: I've been using these ear buds for five weeks now. I use them for hours every day and they continue to impress me. On three occasions only the right channel had a signal when I initially put them in to listen to music, but each time I put them back in the case and took them out again (which turned them off and on) and they worked normally. I've only had this happen with music and only when I first take them out of the case (i.e. it hasn't happened while on a call or after I've been listening to music with both working).","5","61fvUKyPotL._SY88.jpg"

"product1","top review","22","Callie","4.0 out of 5 stars","Good for the price","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2024","Good for the price, however there are SOME issues.If you have tiny or sensitive ears, these are not comfortable. I'm unfortunately unable to wear them for periods longer than 40-ish minutes due to how paiful they are to wear. This is just an issue with my ears, but if you are like me and you are determined to get these, wear them upside down. It's significantly less painful.The audio is loud. Even on the lowest setting, these things are pretty loud. I have autism and when im having a sensory overload, the lowest settings of these are very painful. Wholeheartedly recommend using these with an app like spotify where it allows you to lower the volume further via the app.The touch sensors on the side are SO SENSITIVE. My hair manages to trigger them, yet when I actually want to skip a song or pause and play my music, it doesn't work to well and can lead to some frustration.The audio quality itself seems okay. It's definitely not like my more expensive over-the-ear headphones, but it isn't grating or awful. I don't use these for calls,  so I'm not too sure about the mic quality.Battery life is pretty nice, the overall feel of the earbuds in my hands are nice also. The case feels a little cheap on the outside, but not to the point where I feel like the lid is going to break off. Just be careful not to drop them.I like the color and appearance of them! They look exactly like the picture. I haven't had any issues with the case or charging, but please be aware when you first turn it all on, the case battery is going to drop very quickly to charge the headphones.The earbuds come with a lifetime warranty you can activate for free. I reached out to customer support regarding a question, and they replied within the next business day and were very helpful.TL;DR:Hurts tiny ears, loud minimum audio, touch gestures kinda suck... buuutttt audio itself good for the price, the earbuds come with a free lifetime warranty, battery life is nice, they look exactly as advertised, customer service is quick and efficient.Overall 4/5‚≠êÔ∏è","4",""
"product1","top review","23","Julius Forte","5.0 out of 5 stars","Amazing buds/price/service... buy these!","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023","Yes, my subject line sounds like that trash hyperbole you get on annoying pop-up ads on your Smartphone! And ironically, it usually has to do with ear buds. There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.Now, first off, I am just a customer‚Ä¶ never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to ‚Äúclick on a review‚Äù for a discount or whatever. No‚Ä¶ the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I‚Äôm really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what ‚Äúguts‚Äù that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex‚Ä¶ nor expensive. How company‚Äôs like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!I‚Äôve tried those ‚ÄúRolls Royce‚Äù buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.Their Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman‚Äôs voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.I‚Äôve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.And a note on their service. I‚Äôve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company‚Äôs for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it‚Äôs nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.Now, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY‚Ä¶ yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham ‚Äúlifetime warranties‚Äù, that corrupt company‚Äôs like Hammacher Schlemmer  have.I had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry‚Äôs support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good ‚Äòol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.A day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience.  The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.So, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on‚Ä¶ and they love them. And none of had any problems.I‚Äôm sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I‚Äôve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!Yes, goodness and quality still exist. It‚Äôs rare‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs out there!","5",""

(UPDATED: Excellent Customer Service!)","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2024","(UPDATE: Right after expressing my concerns with the sound quality, customer service reached out to see how they could help! I added a star because it's REFRESHING when customer service is actually great!)... it's got issues.At the time of writing, I'm writing this review, mostly because this product has SO much promise, but it has two issues that left me disappointed. Also, for preface, I'm a filmmaker who also makes music, so I'd say I have a good ear for sound.First, the good: The build quality is EXCELLENT, especially for the price! It's a bit bigger than some competitors, but it's really light and well-made. The screen is helpful, and the earbuds themselves feel solid. Bluetooth connectivity is straightforward as well!Now, onto my critiques: A smaller one, but still important, but the noise cancelling just doesn't work on this. While it does a good job blocking out sound, I've had friends and family members complain about my microphone when calling. The product actually lists that it has some sort of noise canceling for calls, but it's nothing really special.But that's not my biggest problem.It's just the sound is SO off! Some people might be able to get used to it, but I can't. It was really shocking because the first impressions were great, and I don't get why so many people have reviewed this so positively. As someone who listens to a wide range of music (hip hop, rock, pop, even traditional East Asian music!), the earbuds do a poor job of outputting a clear sound. The mix is REALLY muddy, especially at the low frequencies. Basses really mess up male vocals, and high frequencies are airy. The mids seem completely missing, almost like the inverse of what you'd hear through a phone!If they can just adjust their EQ to sound fuller (and maybe tone down the bass), then these would be INCREDIBLE. Again, I'm SHOCKED that this has as many positive reviews. I'd rather buy $8 wired earbuds over these. This product has HUGE POTENTIAL, but completely WASTED buy the actual sound quality.(And no, I will not be downloading EQ's specifically for these earbuds. I have too many devices)The Tozo T6 (my previous earbuds) are a great alt at this price point (whenever it's on sale at least), but since I wanted to try something new, I'm sticking with the JBL Vibes. They sound great :)","4",""

You need to be mindful not to close it too quickly after taking out the bud you want to use.  As long as you give it a few seconds before closing it, it appears to reliably recharge the other one (it loses a very small amount of power since it was activated upon opening the charger).I didn't have to take this precaution with my old Boltune earbuds, but I couldn't find those online anymore, so I had to try something else (these ones).Aside from the charging issue, which I appear to have resolved, according to people I talk to over the phone, these don't sound as good as my old buds, but people don't seem to have a hard time understanding me.  That said, I don't often hold conversations in loud environments, and so I don't know how well these filter out loud background noise.Still, so far so good.  They're comfortable and they sound pretty good, especially for the price.  In fact, for the price, they're really good.","5",""

I wanted an Air Pod style ear bud but didn't want to pay Air Pod prices. I can't compare these to the aforementioned product, but for my needs these fit the bill.Pairing was simple and automatic (I have an Android phone for reference, Samsung Note 10 to be exact). They connect every time to my phone with no issues.The sound is entirely adequate with the treble and bass both coming through clearly and cleanly. I use these at work (CNC machines) and while working outside around my house cutting grass and using various like tools. I never have a problem hearing my music or the spoken word.Bluetooth connectivity and range is good as well. I walked into a different room with multiple obstacles between the ear buds and my phone and the sound never cut out. Distance apart was about 40 feet. I'm sure I could have gone further. I haven't done a formal test of this as of yet. Usually my phone is clipped to my belt or laying just a few feet away so it doesn't cross my mind to be honest.They fit comfortably in my ears and the included charger keeps them ready to go. I can listen to them for at least two 10 hour days before I plug the charger in, but could go longer if I had to.Overall these are good ear buds for not a lot of money. I read the reviews on these before I purchased them to help me make a decision and I hope my review helps someone else make up their mind.","5",""

I have tried every size of earpiece, and they just do not stay put. The problem is the sound quality is highly dependent on the positioning in the ear canal. So the sound can be rich and full, but will quickly lose bass and become thin as the bud slips out of my ear. Maybe I have weird shaped ears, because I have never ever had a set of earbuds that fit snuggly. I usually use over the ear phones, but wanted something small to carry around with me. For the price, I guess they are fine, but I wont be using these often because of the poor fit.","3",""

Just removing the earbud from your ear and placing it in your pocket or even on the counter may result in starting the music, and then draining your battery. While wearing them, I can ""stop/start"" by accidentally raising my arm too close to my ear. It's just too sensitive. I now know I prefer an actual button.","3",""

Until now!I don't like the over the ear hooks because I wear glasses and the ear piece of my glasses puts pressure on the ear hook and after about an hour, the area behind my ear starts to hurt really bad. I've tried several different kinds of ear buds that are supposed to fit snuggly in the ear and not fall out, but after about 30 min, guess what... They start working their way out! One night, I was at work, wearing one of my earbuds and washing dishes. Before I knew it, the earbud slipped out and fell into the dish water. Thank God they were the water proof kind.A few weeks ago, I saw the T12's and thought, what the hell... They were on sale, so I figured I'd give them a shot. There were a few factors involved with making the decision to get these.1. They were on sale. (Who doesn't like to save money?)2. The battery life they claimed to have. I was skeptical about that. 12 to 14 hours, continuous play? The ones I was wearing have a 4 hour battery life, but had magnetic batteries that I could just change out without having to remove the earbud. The first night at work, I fired up my music at around 5p.m. and listened to it for my entire 9 hour shift and on the drive home. I was immediately impressed!3. Stayed put the entire time! After a little while, I could hardly tell that it was there. While I'm working, I only use the left earbud cause I have a headset on my right ear. No more worries about the earbud working loose and falling into the dish water again! One thing I did change was the earbud tip. I replaced the soft silicone tip with a memory foam cushion tip. They aren't cheap, but they are well worth the money.4. Sounds quality is great! No static in the background and the sound is nice and clear. I can actually hear the lyrics!I told myself that I'd give them 2 weeks of use before deciding that they really were all that, or if I was going to have to go back to my search for the perfect earbuds... Again, if in fact, they even existed! Well, the 2 week  trial period is over, and here I am, doing something that I never do! Writing a review for them!Seriously folks, I highly recommend these earbuds. If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would in a heart beat!One thing I am going to do is order another pair of them, as soon as I'm done with this review, to have as back-ups!","5",""

Lost them, damaged them. Had 3 pairs total. And they are pretty pricey as you well know and being easy to drop and lose, I started to think are they worth it for the price.I ran into these on Amazon and did my little research. But it never matters until you actually try them yourself. Everything sounded good but now it was time to see if I wasn't going to be let down as they are only $21 and you know the old saying ""you get what you pay for "".These IMO beat Apple air pods! What I feared proved to be wrong. The sound quality and bass is very good. The functionality and ease of calling, answer phone calls and playing music is of ease. And one of the top reasons for me personally for getting these is the use of Siri.They exceeded my expectations by far! And the fact that it is over 80% cheaper than Apple air pods is insane! I seriously can't believe the quality.This has to be one of my better purchases on Amazon period!  It's a steal!I've told a few people that these are better than Apple air pods, in my opinion of course. And being that I've had a few Apple airpods, I'm more than qualified to have this opinion.This is one of those products that will be very hard to believe for many. But I truly love that fact that when I'm speaking to someone else on the other line, they can hear me clearly. With my Apple air pods, unfortunately after a while that was always an issue.

The compact charging case not only keeps the earbuds protected but also ensures they are always ready for use when needed. This feature is especially convenient for on-the-go individuals who require a reliable audio companion throughout the day.Navigating playback controls is straightforward, thanks to the touch-sensitive surfaces on each earbud.

Until now!I don't like the over the ear hooks because I wear glasses and the ear piece of my glasses puts pressure on the ear hook and after about an hour, the area behind my ear starts to hurt really bad. I've tried several different kinds of ear buds that are supposed to fit snuggly in the ear and not fall out, but after about 30 min, guess what... They start working their way out! One night, I was at work, wearing one of my earbuds and washing dishes. Before I knew it, the earbud slipped out and fell into the dish water. Thank God they were the water proof kind.A few weeks ago, I saw the T12's and thought, what the hell... They were on sale, so I figured I'd give them a shot. There were a few factors involved with making the decision to get these.1. They were on sale. (Who doesn't like to save money?)2. The battery life they claimed to have. I was skeptical about that. 12 to 14 hours, continuous play? The ones I was wearing have a 4 hour battery life, but had magnetic batteries that I could just change out without having to remove the earbud. The first night at work, I fired up my music at around 5p.m. and listened to it for my entire 9 hour shift and on the drive home. I was immediately impressed!3. Stayed put the entire time! After a little while, I could hardly tell that it was there. While I'm working, I only use the left earbud cause I have a headset on my right ear. No more worries about the earbud working loose and falling into the dish water again! One thing I did change was the earbud tip. I replaced the soft silicone tip with a memory foam cushion tip. They aren't cheap, but they are well worth the money.4. Sounds quality is great! No static in the background and the sound is nice and clear. I can actually hear the lyrics!I told myself that I'd give them 2 weeks of use before deciding that they really were all that, or if I was going to have to go back to my search for the perfect earbuds... Again, if in fact, they even existed! Well, the 2 week  trial period is over, and here I am, doing something that I never do! Writing a review for them!Seriously folks, I highly recommend these earbuds. If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would in a heart beat!One thing I am going to do is order another pair of them, as soon as I'm done with this review, to have as back-ups!","5",""

Lost them, damaged them. Had 3 pairs total. And they are pretty pricey as you well know and being easy to drop and lose, I started to think are they worth it for the price.I ran into these on Amazon and did my little research. But it never matters until you actually try them yourself. Everything sounded good but now it was time to see if I wasn't going to be let down as they are only $21 and you know the old saying ""you get what you pay for "".These IMO beat Apple air pods! What I feared proved to be wrong. The sound quality and bass is very good. The functionality and ease of calling, answer phone calls and playing music is of ease. And one of the top reasons for me personally for getting these is the use of Siri.They exceeded my expectations by far! And the fact that it is over 80% cheaper than Apple air pods is insane! I seriously can't believe the quality.This has to be one of my better purchases on Amazon period!  It's a steal!I've told a few people that these are better than Apple air pods, in my opinion of course. And being that I've had a few Apple airpods, I'm more than qualified to have this opinion.This is one of those products that will be very hard to believe for many. But I truly love that fact that when I'm speaking to someone else on the other line, they can hear me clearly. With my Apple air pods, unfortunately after a while that was always an issue. I know many people can vouch for thatAnd what do you have to lose? They're only about 23 dollars.","5",""

I wanted an Air Pod style ear bud but didn't want to pay Air Pod prices. I can't compare these to the aforementioned product, but for my needs these fit the bill.Pairing was simple and automatic (I have an Android phone for reference, Samsung Note 10 to be exact). They connect every time to my phone with no issues.The sound is entirely adequate with the treble and bass both coming through clearly and cleanly. I use these at work (CNC machines) and while working outside around my house cutting grass and using various like tools. I never have a problem hearing my music or the spoken word.Bluetooth connectivity and range is good as well. I walked into a different room with multiple obstacles between the ear buds and my phone and the sound never cut out. Distance apart was about 40 feet. I'm sure I could have gone further. I haven't done a formal test of this as of yet. Usually my phone is clipped to my belt or laying just a few feet away so it doesn't cross my mind to be honest.They fit comfortably in my ears and the included charger keeps them ready to go. I can listen to them for at least two 10 hour days before I plug the charger in, but could go longer if I had to.Overall these are good ear buds for not a lot of money. I read the reviews on these before I purchased them to help me make a decision and I hope my review helps someone else make up their mind.","5",""

Then, furious about the relationship one of her sisters (who is, unrealistically, practically beatified) develops with her ex once she's left town, she refuses to maintain contact or allow her daughter to have contact with any of them for more than 20 years.

The biggest disappointment of all though is the ridiculous ""powerful love story"" between William and Sylvie which you could see coming from a mile away although not for any reason that made sense.

After all I loved Napolitano‚Äôs Dear Edward and Hello, Beautiful has been called a ‚Äúhomage to Louisa May Alcott‚Äôs timeless classic‚Äù Little Women. That‚Äôs just plain wrong. It‚Äôs not even in the same stratosphere as that beloved book. While I like Little Women, I don‚Äôt love it like my daughter-in-law does. After being disappointed, I passed my copy of Hello, Beautiful to her to see what I was missing. She agreed it was similar in that it was a family saga about four very close sisters and the young man who comes into their lives, but it should not be compared to Little Women. My daughter-in-law gave it only 2 stars out of 5. We both agreed that in a large part of the book, particularly the middle, readers spend too much time inside the minds of the characters. As another critic explained Napolitano needs to show us, not tell us. Because of this, the novel became repetitive and kind of a slog fest. The book is not horrible, but it‚Äôs not the great book I expected.","3",""

I liked the writing style which  easily drew me into the character's psyches and I was quickly hooked on wanting to know what would happen to them.  The oldest sister is intent on mapping her future, like a scientist with laser- focused determination and wearing blinders. We learn about each character via chapters told from first-person perspective.This book is a deep character study of a family, with so little plotline beyond that of how they grow as they age and what happens to them as a result of their personal and conjoined perspectives that  I eventually grew weary of the narrow focus, so rich in character but lacking in the other elements that make a book interesting to me; action, setting, place.  As others have mentioned the middle of the book gets too bogged down in head-game thinking/telling.Half a star for NOT writing politics into the narrative as so many authors are prone to do today.

I haven't wholly shared her taste in books, but I've always looked forward to seeing book recommendations from a smart, literate thought leader.Wow. Oprah and I surely weren't on the same page this time.‚ÄéAnn Napolitano is a highly skilled writer. Her words exude warmth and empathy, and her characters -- major and minor -- spring to life. I would have given her 5 stars for drawing me into the characters' inner lives and making me root for a more compelling plot, but I ended up hard-pressed to justify giving it 3 stars.Somehow, I just found this book difficult to wade through. I couldn't stay focused on the story. It wasn't the sudden onset of an attention span issue or cognition problem for me. Perhaps I was a bit distracted because of a huge breaking national news story--but, heck, we always have huge breaking national news stories, don't we? This just about never happens to me.But I failed to buy into the narrative. The characters were real, and there was character development, but it took too much time and provided almost no satisfaction by the time it happened. I forced myself to finish the book only because I felt that the payoff may have been worth it.It wasn't. For those who started to read the book, I want to warn you that there's no light at the end of the tunnel. For me, the time I invested in finishing this book would have been far better spent in joyfully reading other works. YMMV, of course.By the way, I loved ""Dear Edward,"" by the same author.

William was born to a family suffering a great loss. And even in the first few pages with William, we come to know him in all that he isn‚Äôt instead of what he is. It‚Äôs an interesting way to construct a character.In the next chapter, we meet Julia and all that she is and all that she has. She is a lot, has a lot. Specifically, things that William does not. She has a close, loving family, and she has a plan and the will to carry it out.William and Julia meet in college and begin a wonderful life together. We follow over the years as eventually, William's past comes to light and the very thing that drew them together threatens to tear them apart.I read this one towards the end of 2022 and had to hold onto this review for over six months. It was torture. It was one of the best books I read last year, and I can‚Äôt wait for you to read it. It would make a great book club selection as there would be a lot to discuss. I imagine readers on opposing sides of imaginary lines, arguing their point. And they would both be right. That is the beauty of this book.Let‚Äôs talk about what I especially liked about it.The first thing I loved and noticed was the sentence structure. There is a pattern to the structure that creates a rhythm that increases reading enjoyment. Essentially it is very easy to read.The second thing I loved is what I noted previously. I loved how William was constructed as a character. His pages felt vacuous. As if I were leaving a part of myself there with him on every page. There is a scene early on when William is describing a moment with a professor. That passage is so telling of William and his lens for seeing his world and interacting with it.The third thing I loved was the number of emotions that were stirred within me. I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was angry with a fictional character. It‚Äôs been six months and I still disagree with some of the characters' choices.Although this was a five-star read for me I do want to note how critical the writing is. These characters are beautifully imperfect, and the narrative, no matter the character, was severe in correction. This can lead to a lack of empathy toward the characters and their situation. It didn‚Äôt affect me much, but I think readers should be aware of that going in.HELLO BEAUTIFUL comes out on March 14, 2023, and I highly recommend it.Now an Oprah Book Club pick for March 2023HELLO BEAUTIFUL‚Ä¶‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èThanks to Random House Publishing Group - Random House, The Dial Press for the advanced copy!","5",""

I can understand why she literally had to write the dates at the beginning of every chapter because the setting didn‚Äôt in any way reflect the time period.In 1997, Alice and her friend were singing along to records? Really? They didn‚Äôt have CDs? Was the author alive in 1997?When Alice is in college in the early 2000s and searches for her aunt‚Äôs artwork, the author doesn‚Äôt even mention the internet. I understand not dwelling on it, but surely there are relevant implications about the ease of uncovering secrets in a world that is suddenly so much more connected than it has ever been before.Ultimately I gave up after the Alice chapter that ends in 2003. You mean to tell me in 2001, Alice is in Boston, and her mother is in New York, and the author was in no way compelled to even mention 9/11? At all? Wouldn‚Äôt that have been a very real driver for the sisters to contact Julia to maybe, I don‚Äôt know, find out if she was even alive? Or did they just shrug and sit around hoping for another postcard?The next chapter skips to 2008, and I don‚Äôt see any point in continuing.

What I appreciate most with Oprah's fiction picks is the selections tend to be a cut above (i.e. more literature) than morning show or other celeb book clubs. (I esp enjoyed Oprah's early picks back in late 90s.) I'm sad to report this was a big miss for me. Having been raised with 4 sisters in blue-collar Chicago, I thought it'd be a slam dunk, but I went from being underwhelmed to disappointed to annoyed. Pains me to write a mediocre review as author likely poured her heart and soul into it, but imo this book needed another year editing and revising, as this just wasn't there yet. A few specifics:* I applaud author for attempting to give characters depth & complexity but she violated basic rule of show, don't tell. Too much of the characters' personalities were explained with excess exposition but not SHOWN to readers through actions or dialogue.* While I don't adhere that authors should write only what they know, it was obvious to me early on the author didn't grow up with sisters, nor grow up or spend years in Pilsen or blue-collar Chicago. Neither felt authentic. Felt more as if author was on outside observing or imagining versus having lived it. I can overlook some tells, but the more those slips/omissions/errors add up, the more a reader loses faith in the entire story.*William's upbringing also didn't ring true. I can understand grief-stricken parents emotionally absent in a child's life, but not to the degree explained (not shown) in the book. More development and examples were needed, as parents cannot simply ignore a child--they still need to nurse, feed, cloth and shelter, etc. It's easy to tell but author needed to again SHOW us how cold parents can be there, but not present.* On plus side, the story & writing comes most alive to me with passages on basketball--the relationships, the tempo, the love of the game, the history. Here's where the author did her homework and really did a nice job translating it, esp to female readership (not to sound sexist, as I'm a woman who played basketball in her youth but still learned a few things or two and appreciated the insights she brought.)I'll leave it there as I don't mean to tear down a book that's not horrible, just not great. Possibly my disappointment is greater than most because I came up with high expectations and this just wasn't credible for me. As other reviewers noted, it's not a bad beach read, but not literature and not Oprah-caliber.  (Sorry for any typos--please don't review my review lol.)","3",""

Like the classic Little Women, we are intertwined into the sisters‚Äô close-knit family, and we bear witness to their life‚Äôs highlights, but more so their downfalls. Oddly, as close as the sisters are displayed to the reader, we see very little in the way of communication between the four of them.There are marriages, births, loves and losses stretched across thirty-some-odd years. There is a beautifully storied first half, engulfing the reader. The middle of our story is lackluster though and a bit drawn out and I found myself uninterested.The last quarter of the book felt rushed to me like the author knew she had to wrap up the story. One character, in particular, I didn‚Äôt understand at all. She‚Äôs in her early 20s but does not have the inquisitive nature of an early twenty-something. This leads to my disappointment with this character. We have a very unfinished reunion at the very end, and unless there is going to be a sequel, leaves a lot of questions.I know this book is beloved by so many, and I did enjoy it, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I think it was hyped so much that I expected to give it a perfect five-star rating. I‚Äôm going to give Hello Beautiful three out of five stars. It was good, but had the potential to be great.","3","81RrBR6HGgL._SY88.jpg"

It immediately sucks you in with the first sentence. But as I read on and finished it, I had more criticisms than compliments. The characters are very one-dimensional. You get caricatures more than characters that have real depth. For example, Julia is the ""planner."" Cecilia is the ""artist."" And so on. The family dynamic portrayed throughout is sweet but highly unbelievable. I think that I was just expecting more from this one and left feeling disappointed.","3",""

Bauer","3.0 out of 5 stars","Not Believable","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2023","I am giving this book three stars only because I really appreciated Ann Napolitano's book A Good Hard Look, which influenced me to read Flannery O'conner.  I really wanted to like Hello Beautiful, but it was just too unbelievable.  There were hardly any likable characters, with the possible exception of William's basketball friends  It reads more like a soap opera than serious fiction.  For example, in what world other than soap opera can a widow who lives in a blue collar area and whose husband is described as having low paying jobs suddenly be able to move to Miami and hobnob with the wealthy?  How does she support herself?  We aren't told anything other than that she has wealthy friends.  In what world can a recent college graduate with a new baby be able to move to Manhattan (much less the upper east side) and afford childcare , housing, and expensive  clothes while doing research for a college professor?  Huh?  Sounds like fantasy.  And anyone who thinks Hello, Beautiful resembles Little Women obviously hasn't read the book.  The only similarity is that both books are about four sisters.  Can anyone imagine Marmie abandoning her children or not speaking to one of her daughters and granddaughters?  Really?  I had to force myself to finish this book.  As others have said, it was  depressing, peopled with unloving , unloveable , and unbelievable characters.","3",""
"product3","all review","120","KWyly","5.0 out of 5 stars","Beautifully written‚Ä¶","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2024","I love this story about the four Padavano sisters and their parents. Rose is the strong willed matriarch of the family. She strongly believes her husband, Charlie, just doesn‚Äôt quite measure up to what he could have been. Together, they have four daughters. Readers are drawn right into this story and feel every emotion the characters experience. Julie, the eldest of the four sisters, is a planner, a fixer, a girl who knows what she wants and knows how to get it. She has a plan for her life and it doesn‚Äôt include living in a tiny house like where she was raised. Second daughter is quiet Sylvie, a reader who has worked in the public library since she was thirteen and sneaks kisses from the boys behind the shelves knowing she doesn‚Äôt want a boyfriend. She doesn‚Äôt  take the boys seriously because she is just practicing for her one true love. The twins who are energetic, fun loving girls, round out the Padavano sisters. Then there is William a loner, ignored and never loved at home, socially awkward, always wondering where he fits in, how should he behave, and why he wasn‚Äôt enough for his parents. He only feels at home on the basketball court. Julie has decided William is just what she needs to get her life plan started. In alternating chapters, the four main characters tell their story with each chapter bearing the character‚Äôs name. Quoting Walt Whitman‚Äôs poetry and making comparisons of the four sisters to the sisters in Little Women by Alcott, this book is more than a family saga. This book is a love story.

I'm quite sad that I've just finished it, because I don't want to say goodbye to William and the close knit family of four sisters he married into.  My own spare childhood resembles William's.  Yet this novel is a way of seeing what it might be like to be raised in an exuberant, complicated, loving family... and how it evolves over time, as each girl becomes her own self... and William comes to realize that he matters.What impresses me most about the writing of Ann Napolitano is her ability to go to the heart of the matter.  She allows us to see the inner lives of her characters, their aspirations, self-doubts, determination, losses and joys.  There is grace here... saving grace.Perhaps I'm particulary drawn to a work like this because, as child psychologist, I've spent years studying how childhood experiences influence who we become, and the healing that is sometimes needed when those experiences have been less than ideal.  Napolitano shows here how it's often the people closest to us, who care about us, who facilitate our healing.  What the author has created here feels firmly based in reality and the challenges human beings face, and, thankfully, she draws these characters to unexpected reconciliation.","5",""

But they are mistaken.His girl tells him they will marry. She tells him he will be a professor. He starts to study. She tells him it's time for a baby. By the time the baby becomes her focus, he realizes he loves her favorite sister. He doesn't want to teach. He wants to work with the basketball team, the only people who ever truly saw him, and cared about him. And because he never knew parental love, he is afraid to be a parent.Read one of the best family stories I've ever enjoyed in Hello Beautiful. See how deftly the author draws her characters and allows you to see them by their actions from several points of view so that you learn their emotions and motivations layer by layer. By the end, you understand and forgive.Forgiveness‚Äîand the lack thereof‚Äî is big in this novel. Having been banished by my mother from my family for several years, I was drawn deeply to the mother who stubbornly kept alive her anger against one of her children for so much longer than mine did. The same woman never forgave her husband for not being the man she expected him to be. She never understood that he was so much more.If you had a family, you understand that families‚Äîeven loving families‚Äîare complicated. Families with problems are even more so. Each person adds his or her own characteristics, talents, opinions, and prejudices to a simmering pot of emotions, misunderstandings, and love. With every stir, the recipe can either boil over or settle into what it was meant to be. It's maybe how we get Forrest's box of chocolates‚Äîyou never know what you're gonna get.Read Hello Beautiful and see that what you thought, or what you were told, or what you expected of someone, is not necessarily the way the story all will turn out. Life is always a surprise at every turn. Why would we expect a book to turn out the way we wish it would? The curveball element makes life‚Äîand books‚Äîall the more worthwhile.","5",""

My thirty- something daughters loved it. I, however, found the story of the sisters, their mother and William, the boyfriend/ husband to be very off putting. The sisters seem to be in such lock-step that I found their relationships to be unhealthy. Not beautiful at all. They are mothered by a woman who when widowed shuts one daughter and granddaughter completely out of her life for decades, and without a thought has little contact with the other three. William wanders around in a daze and constantly needs rescuing by 1. The sisters 2. Julia. 3. Sylvie and 4. Alice, the daughter he gave up without much thought as an infant. When tragedy occurs all of the characters gallop back to Pilsen ( a real Chicago suburb!) and without much discussion forgive one another‚Äôs rather grave transgressions.This story simply doesn‚Äôt touch the hearts and minds of the struggles it takes to be a fully formed forgiving, compassionate, yet sometimes failure of a family.Another Oprah miss.","2",""

Though disagreeable, Rose at least had some perspective on her children. Alas it was not to be. And then there's the author's need to explain, over and over, her characters' motivations rather than trust that her writing could show the reader. Not a few words could have been saved by letting the characters' actions do the explaining. In the end there's little for the reader to do but power through because the author has trusted us with no other role.","2",""

"product3","top review","4","Bookworm","3.0 out of 5 stars","Disappointed ---characters simply not authentic","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023","I bought hardcover & Kindle editions on day of release after seeing Oprah rave about it on CBS. What I appreciate most with Oprah's fiction picks is the selections tend to be a cut above (i.e. more literature) than morning show or other celeb book clubs. (I esp enjoyed Oprah's early picks back in late 90s.) I'm sad to report this was a big miss for me. Having been raised with 4 sisters in blue-collar Chicago, I thought it'd be a slam dunk, but I went from being underwhelmed to disappointed to annoyed. Pains me to write a mediocre review as author likely poured her heart and soul into it, but imo this book needed another year editing and revising, as this just wasn't there yet. A few specifics:* I applaud author for attempting to give characters depth & complexity but she violated basic rule of show, don't tell. Too much of the characters' personalities were explained with excess exposition but not SHOWN to readers through actions or dialogue.* While I don't adhere that authors should write only what they know, it was obvious to me early on the author didn't grow up with sisters, nor grow up or spend years in Pilsen or blue-collar Chicago. Neither felt authentic. Felt more as if author was on outside observing or imagining versus having lived it. I can overlook some tells, but the more those slips/omissions/errors add up, the more a reader loses faith in the entire story.*William's upbringing also didn't ring true. I can understand grief-stricken parents emotionally absent in a child's life, but not to the degree explained (not shown) in the book. More development and examples were needed, as parents cannot simply ignore a child--they still need to nurse, feed, cloth and shelter, etc. It's easy to tell but author needed to again SHOW us how cold parents can be there, but not present.* On plus side, the story & writing comes most alive to me with passages on basketball--the relationships, the tempo, the love of the game, the history. Here's where the author did her homework and really did a nice job translating it, esp to female readership (not to sound sexist, as I'm a woman who played basketball in her youth but still learned a few things or two and appreciated the insights she brought.)I'll leave it there as I don't mean to tear down a book that's not horrible, just not great. Possibly my disappointment is greater than most because I came up with high expectations and this just wasn't credible for me. As other reviewers noted, it's not a bad beach read, but not literature and not Oprah-caliber.  (Sorry for any typos--please don't review my review lol.)","3",""

I'm quite sad that I've just finished it, because I don't want to say goodbye to William and the close knit family of four sisters he married into.  My own spare childhood resembles William's.  Yet this novel is a way of seeing what it might be like to be raised in an exuberant, complicated, loving family... and how it evolves over time, as each girl becomes her own self... and William comes to realize that he matters.What impresses me most about the writing of Ann Napolitano is her ability to go to the heart of the matter.  She allows us to see the inner lives of her characters, their aspirations, self-doubts, determination, losses and joys.  There is grace here... saving grace.Perhaps I'm particulary drawn to a work like this because, as child psychologist, I've spent years studying how childhood experiences influence who we become, and the healing that is sometimes needed when those experiences have been less than ideal.  Napolitano shows here how it's often the people closest to us, who care about us, who facilitate our healing.  What the author has created here feels firmly based in reality and the challenges human beings face, and, thankfully, she draws these characters to unexpected reconciliation.","5",""

But they are mistaken.His girl tells him they will marry. She tells him he will be a professor. He starts to study. She tells him it's time for a baby. By the time the baby becomes her focus, he realizes he loves her favorite sister. He doesn't want to teach. He wants to work with the basketball team, the only people who ever truly saw him, and cared about him. And because he never knew parental love, he is afraid to be a parent.Read one of the best family stories I've ever enjoyed in Hello Beautiful. See how deftly the author draws her characters and allows you to see them by their actions from several points of view so that you learn their emotions and motivations layer by layer. By the end, you understand and forgive.Forgiveness‚Äîand the lack thereof‚Äî is big in this novel. Having been banished by my mother from my family for several years, I was drawn deeply to the mother who stubbornly kept alive her anger against one of her children for so much longer than mine did. The same woman never forgave her husband for not being the man she expected him to be. She never understood that he was so much more.If you had a family, you understand that families‚Äîeven loving families‚Äîare complicated. Families with problems are even more so. Each person adds his or her own characteristics, talents, opinions, and prejudices to a simmering pot of emotions, misunderstandings, and love. With every stir, the recipe can either boil over or settle into what it was meant to be. It's maybe how we get Forrest's box of chocolates‚Äîyou never know what you're gonna get.Read Hello Beautiful and see that what you thought, or what you were told, or what you expected of someone, is not necessarily the way the story all will turn out. Life is always a surprise at every turn. Why would we expect a book to turn out the way we wish it would? The curveball element makes life‚Äîand books‚Äîall the more worthwhile.","5",""

"product4","all review","110","Ann S. Epstein","3.0 out of 5 stars","Cluttered","Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023","The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store by James McBride is the story of pre-WWII Chicken Hill, a poor area in Pottstown, Pennsylvania inhabited by Jews and Negroes. Among the ‚Äúgood‚Äù Jews are Chona, the generous proprietress of the title establishment, and her open-minded husband, Moshe, a theater entrepreneur. Among the ‚Äúgood‚Äù Negroes are Nate, a hard-working man with a past, and his good-hearted and loyal wife Addie, who have taken in Dodo, their bright but deaf orphaned nephew who the State wants to cart off to an ‚Äúeducational‚Äù mental institution. The town itself harbors many ‚Äúbad‚Äù bigots, most notably the despised but powerful Doc Roberts. The collusion of Negroes and Jews to save Dodo drives the story, but what should be a propulsive tale is instead a novel cluttered with less-than-minor characters, confusing plot fragments, and digressions that merely show off the author‚Äôs wit. McBride needs an editor with the chutzpah to tell him to cut three-quarters of the self-indulgent prose. As a novelist myself (see my Amazon author page www.amazon.com/author/asewovenwords), I‚Äôve learned that at least ninety-percent of the fascinating (to me) information I discover in my research should remain in my notes. Facts serve fiction when they further character and plot. Otherwise, they belong in engaging nonfiction tracts. The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store is somewhat redeemed by the touching Epilogue, but it doesn‚Äôt justify the hours spent reading what precedes it. If you enjoyed McBride‚Äôs Deacon King Kong, you‚Äôll probably like The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. If, like me, you were irritated by the former, I expect you‚Äôll be impatient with his latest book too.","3",""

I knew that going into the book. (Oh, digression--did you know that he also played with the band, The Remainders? That‚Äôs a band with other writers like Amy Tan, Dave Barry, Barbara Kingsolver, Stephen King, Maya Angelou and several others who played for charity and fundraising). Anyway, I mention his musicianship because I see it all over the pages of The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.This is the first book I‚Äôve read by McBride (definitely more to come), so pardon my schoolgirlish, giggly first crush for the way that his writing lifts me up, how his words and characters opened my heart, only to break it, and then put it back together in a most absolute and tender way. James McBride is a kind, gentle soul, and his writing reflects this‚Äîhis ability to bring the world together in a novel. He honors humanity. We are all connected, and this author compels that naturally from his characters. Now, how great is that, yeah?I want to put this in your hands and promise you a magnificent reading experience. It starts off in a shaggy dog kind of way, with an ensemble of characters, several who possess whimsical names like Fatty, Big Soap, Monkey Pants, Dodo. And their names fit flawlessly to their nature. The story starts with a 1972 prologue‚Äîa human skeleton is found in an old abandoned well, and then the body of the story begins in 1936 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, a place called Chicken Hill, where Jews, immigrants, and Black folks lived side by side, sometimes in harmony, other times in discord, but here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîthe goodness of people, the kindness of their hearts‚Äîthat is what ultimately rises to the top.For the story to unfold, there has to be some sinister aspects, too‚Äîaren‚Äôt we still fighting the fight of ignorance, bigotry, corruption, meanness? But, in the McBride world, well, we also follow the long stretch of yarn as it wends around this way and that, through streets and backyards, dirt roads, onto hills and a shul and a church, through tunnels and a dance hall. And The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.I don‚Äôt need to rehash the plot, but there are a few fun facts about this book worth mentioning in a review. Such as, there are an abundance of characters introduced early on, and then again later on, before the plot actually launches. That‚Äôs the shaggy part. We don‚Äôt get to the plot too quickly‚Äîinstead, Mcbride takes his time, builds the characters. They are already leaping off the pages by the time the plot rolls in.There are subplots, too, but in the end, they all weave their chords and come together. McBride may slow your roll at first, but it‚Äôs a winning bonanza of breadth and depth, from the smallest detail to the broadest design. Scenes that seem initially inconsequential become key notes later on.Early on, we meet the arresting Jewess, Chona. Chona is an unforgettable female protagonist‚ÄîI‚Äôm keeping her in my journal of best. female. characters. ever. She is handicapped with a limp‚Äîbut her limp doesn‚Äôt stop her strength of purpose, her fierce dignity, her bounteous benevolence, her gentle grace, and her consummate integrity. You will fall in love with her, just like Moshe, the theater and dance hall owner, did. Moshe and Chona dared to welcome change and inclusivity to their part of the world.At this time, in the 1930s, Black people were almost exclusively cast in menial jobs. But Moshe books Black jazz bands to play at his theater, and successfully includes all tribes together at the dance hall, who ‚Äúfrolicked and laughed, dancing as if they were birds enjoying flight for the first time.‚Äù Chona runs the grocery store, and extends credit to anyone who can‚Äôt afford to pay; she rarely keeps a record of their debt. The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store may lose money, but it is rich in goodwill and kindness.Back to this being like a musical book‚Äîa jazzy book. Jazz music conjures that raspy, soulful, edgy flavor, blended from a mix of cultures and harmonies. McBride embraces those diverse, insistent, zingy, soul-stirring rhythms and blues into the narrative threads of his novel. I can hear the swing and the chase, the boogie and the blues, the sounds that go everywhere at once and jelly roll the story within a complex set of fusion and feelings. It‚Äôs also just a damned good story!The narrative pulls you here and there, up and down, and when you meet Dodo, the sweet and barely teenaged deaf kid, your protective instincts will wrap yourself around him and never want to let him go. And, when Dodo meets Monkey Pants‚Äîwell, this right there‚Äîthe heart of the novel that will break you in pieces.At times, I had a wellspring of tears‚Äînot just for joy or anguish. Sure, comedy and tragedy fill these pages. But McBride‚Äôs natural humanity and gentle nature is the colossal, phenomenal heart of the book. The author steps aside, he doesn‚Äôt ever intrude. The core of the narrative are the characters. Their cacophony becomes a coda for living large.This tale made me want to be better, to do better, to open my eyes to all the missed connections, to fix the broken chords and forge new ones, and seek eternally to strengthen them. We are humanity, we are the essential substance to add love to the world, one modest good deed at a time. That is The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.","5",""

It absolutely lives up to all the accolades.Despite ‚Äúthe skeleton in the well‚Äù mentioned in the first line of the book, this isn‚Äôt a conventional who-done-it. Yes, the mystery of the skeleton hovers quietly over the story, but it‚Äôs largely in the background in a narrative about the difficult lives of a diverse group of small-town, lower-class folks trying to get by. Prejudice and discrimination mix with accommodation and friendship, suspicions and mistrust bump up against shared experience and the best of humanity. And the dialog ‚Äì oh the dialog! ‚ÄúSo he balled up his fist‚Ä¶and I mean that white boy reached back and sent that big fist of his rambling through four or five states before it said hello to Fatty.

One bit of advice I have is do not get bogged down trying to keep a list of who everybody is in this 385 (print edition) book because that will ruin the reading experience. Readers will not have any trouble remembering the major important characters of Chicken Hill, a rural area of immigrants - Blacks, Jews from various countries, and poor immigrant Whites. Chona is the polio-crippled daughter of a rabbi whom  Romanian-Jew Moshe finds attractive and full of humor, and it is Chona who runs the Heaven &Earth Grocery Store. Often, she extends credit so that her neighbors can eat, knowing that it is unlikely they can ever repay her in full.This is definitely a character-driven story; many pages are primarily dialogue. This is not a book that everyone will love because it might seem a bit slow in this day and age of thrillers. There are many flawed characters, but the difference between good guys and bad guys is whether a character exhibits any concern for others. (using ""guys"" as a generic human being, as in west coast people who say ""you guys"" meaning persons of any gender being spoken to).  I would say that this is a book about humanity, about the importance of talking to people of other cultures and religions, trying to understand, and- above all- learning to get along for the betterment of our planet.At the end of chapter 7, a 10-year-old Black boy named Dodo is introduced. For me, Dodo's experiences are what made the book a five star. i don't want to say any more, but it is powerful.","5",""

The author, James McBride introduces us to a series of characters living in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas, focusing on the residents of a community called Chicken Hill in the 1930s.  Chicken Hill is home to Pottstown‚Äôs Jewish immigrants, Blacks coming from the South during The Great Migration and immigrants from other European countries. The Heaven & Earth grocery store is owned by a Jewish couple, Chona and Moshe and serves the residents of Chicken Hill. The novel is mostly centered around a 12 year old deaf boy named Dodo, but each character introduced (and there are a lot) also has a story. I gave 4.5 stars because the book has a slow start and it is hard to keep the characters straight, but stick with it! As the book progresses and there is an incident involving Dodo, the characters and their stories begin to connect and the result is an emotional, touching, sometimes infuriating, engrossing story. McBride tells the story in an interesting way with complex dialogue and character development through flashbacks and memories that explain how and why they are the way they are as the events with Dodo begin to unfold and every character is involved or becomes involved in some way.

Perez","4.0 out of 5 stars","Assured, Propulsive, Scathing writing","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024","In the neighborhood of Chicken Hill, Pottstown, Pennsylvania, in June 1972, police found a skeleton, wearing a gold chain with a mezuzah, at the bottom of a well, next to a lot that had been torn down a day earlier to make way for a new neighborhood. They visited the home of the only Jew left on Chicken Hill, on account of the mezuzah; his home stood on the site that almost half a century earlier had been the local synagogue. Because of this, he was deemed a suspect, though he would never face charges. He skipped town almost immediately, and days later the neighborhood was reduced to rubble by a devastating hurricane.Forty-seven years earlier, in 1925, young theater-manager Moshe Ludlow bet the little money he had saved on hiring a famous musical act to play at his small venue. Jews from all over the Northeast came to dance and frolic. Moshe recovered his investment many times over. He married Chona Yakov, the brilliant daughter of the local rabbi, and settled in Chicken Hill, which was then a vibrant community home to Blacks and Jews. As years went by, most affluent Jews moved downtown. Chona refused to move out. Moshe and Chona owned a two-story building that housed the neighborhood‚Äôs only store on the first floor, The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store, and their home on the second floor. The store was a losing business on account of Chona‚Äôs kindness, but it was a regular hangout spot and neighbors loved it.Over the next twelve years, Chicken Hill, and the world at large, undergo seismic changes‚Äîthe local KKK chapter gains popularity, Nazism rises in Europe, and America‚Äôs immigrants begin to question their new way of life. Among all these social changes, Chicken Hill‚Äôs inhabitants undergo personal upheavals as well, but their sense of community remains strong despite the adversities that come their way.The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store is a novel in three parts and an epilogue, told by an omniscient narrator, about the ups and downs of a community between the years 1925-1936, in an ever-changing world. It touches on several themes, such as racial politics, inequality, sexual violence, disability, sense of community and belonging, friendship, and karmic justice.The first thing that struck me as I settled into the story was McBride‚Äôs assured, propulsive, scathing writing. Despite being an ensemble kind of story, each individual character shines thoroughly, so the reader gets to know each character‚Äôs motivations, inner life, idiosyncrasies. I haven‚Äôt been that crazy about an ensemble cast of characters as I was with these. The curmudgeons in the story are some of the most sympathetic people in it.The Heaven‚Ä¶ is by no means a happy novel; there are weighty issues and sadness overload, but they are treated so compassionately and so beautifully that the reader will root for these underdogs.","4",""

The beginning chapters were rough. They didn't flow well as the cadence was off and therefore the story felt  like it stumbled along . It needed better descriptions of physical characteristics of  the people and places in the novel . It also desperately needed humor.  The book is grimly compelling. There are many profound and memorable moments in this book.1930's America was not the promised land of easy living for immigrants and it still isn't today.The book does a decent job of portraying life for people who are not male WASP in 1930's Pennsylvania.It takes place in a community on the outskirts of the main town. The people of the Hill, who are viewed as "" less than "" by  the mainstream WASP town people, are vibrant and hardworking people who are important to the town even if the town does not acknowledge that.The community on the Hill is diverse. Their are many different types of Jewish people, ""Disabled"" ,Blacks, Germans, Italian , and Latino people living there all tied together by Chona, Moshe, The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store and the Theater.Chona, ""Dodo"", and "" Monkey Pants "" are what keeps the story hopeful and compelling.The book does have the underlying message of ""White Privilege"" makes it almost impossible for anyone other than able bodied male WASP to arrive at their full potential and that  immigrants lives are hard. At times the reader feels like this is just a message on continuous repeat. Although on the surface the message of book is that is that if you are not  Male, White, Anglo Saxon Protestant like the original founders of the United States Constitution life is hard, it is really a book about community and how we can all make life better for one another if we stay united and work together.It's a good "" book club"" read but needs humor.","4",""
"product4","all review","143","Tustin, CA","4.0 out of 5 stars","Good read .... until its anticlimactic finish","Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024","The writing flowed easily enough, that I was able to finish the book in 4 sittings.  I found myself slowing down my reading in order to keep pace with all the characters introduced in the book.  Perhaps the author might have restructured his storyline so that there were not too many characters, principal and incidental, for the reader to track.  In the end though, the book left significant loose ends about what would have happened next in the lives of the principal characters.  Ultimately, I felt let down as a reader.  It seems that the author wanted to convey that as difficult and fraught life is, there is basic goodness and redemption that sprinkles the person at different points in his/her life.  While the book indeed dwelled on the characters' difficulties and fraught lives, the author (for me) failed to also narrate redemption in its proper context.  There was a summarized, indirect reference to some level of victory in the end, but its emotional impact was far too downplayed to a brief, hurried epilogue. The ending failed to make me smile, which I suspect is what the author would have hoped for his reader.  Because I felt that the author failed to explore (or narrate) what would have happened to the characters after the ""climax"", the book did not give me a sense of closure; the story felt like it was not on balance.  I could not say that this was one of the best books that I have read.  But by no means is this work uninteresting.","4",""

The author, James McBride introduces us to a series of characters living in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas, focusing on the residents of a community called Chicken Hill in the 1930s.  Chicken Hill is home to Pottstown‚Äôs Jewish immigrants, Blacks coming from the South during The Great Migration and immigrants from other European countries. The Heaven & Earth grocery store is owned by a Jewish couple, Chona and Moshe and serves the residents of Chicken Hill. The novel is mostly centered around a 12 year old deaf boy named Dodo, but each character introduced (and there are a lot) also has a story. I gave 4.5 stars because the book has a slow start and it is hard to keep the characters straight, but stick with it! As the book progresses and there is an incident involving Dodo, the characters and their stories begin to connect and the result is an emotional, touching, sometimes infuriating, engrossing story. McBride tells the story in an interesting way with complex dialogue and character development through flashbacks and memories that explain how and why they are the way they are as the events with Dodo begin to unfold and every character is involved or becomes involved in some way. I both read and sometimes listened to The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store and enjoyed both.","4",""

I knew that going into the book. (Oh, digression--did you know that he also played with the band, The Remainders? That‚Äôs a band with other writers like Amy Tan, Dave Barry, Barbara Kingsolver, Stephen King, Maya Angelou and several others who played for charity and fundraising). Anyway, I mention his musicianship because I see it all over the pages of The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.This is the first book I‚Äôve read by McBride (definitely more to come), so pardon my schoolgirlish, giggly first crush for the way that his writing lifts me up, how his words and characters opened my heart, only to break it, and then put it back together in a most absolute and tender way. James McBride is a kind, gentle soul, and his writing reflects this‚Äîhis ability to bring the world together in a novel. He honors humanity. We are all connected, and this author compels that naturally from his characters. Now, how great is that, yeah?I want to put this in your hands and promise you a magnificent reading experience. It starts off in a shaggy dog kind of way, with an ensemble of characters, several who possess whimsical names like Fatty, Big Soap, Monkey Pants, Dodo. And their names fit flawlessly to their nature. The story starts with a 1972 prologue‚Äîa human skeleton is found in an old abandoned well, and then the body of the story begins in 1936 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, a place called Chicken Hill, where Jews, immigrants, and Black folks lived side by side, sometimes in harmony, other times in discord, but here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîthe goodness of people, the kindness of their hearts‚Äîthat is what ultimately rises to the top.For the story to unfold, there has to be some sinister aspects, too‚Äîaren‚Äôt we still fighting the fight of ignorance, bigotry, corruption, meanness? But, in the McBride world, well, we also follow the long stretch of yarn as it wends around this way and that, through streets and backyards, dirt roads, onto hills and a shul and a church, through tunnels and a dance hall. And The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.I don‚Äôt need to rehash the plot, but there are a few fun facts about this book worth mentioning in a review. Such as, there are an abundance of characters introduced early on, and then again later on, before the plot actually launches. That‚Äôs the shaggy part. We don‚Äôt get to the plot too quickly‚Äîinstead, Mcbride takes his time, builds the characters. They are already leaping off the pages by the time the plot rolls in.There are subplots, too, but in the end, they all weave their chords and come together. McBride may slow your roll at first, but it‚Äôs a winning bonanza of breadth and depth, from the smallest detail to the broadest design. Scenes that seem initially inconsequential become key notes later on.Early on, we meet the arresting Jewess, Chona. Chona is an unforgettable female protagonist‚ÄîI‚Äôm keeping her in my journal of best. female. characters. ever. She is handicapped with a limp‚Äîbut her limp doesn‚Äôt stop her strength of purpose, her fierce dignity, her bounteous benevolence, her gentle grace, and her consummate integrity. You will fall in love with her, just like Moshe, the theater and dance hall owner, did. Moshe and Chona dared to welcome change and inclusivity to their part of the world.At this time, in the 1930s, Black people were almost exclusively cast in menial jobs. But Moshe books Black jazz bands to play at his theater, and successfully includes all tribes together at the dance hall, who ‚Äúfrolicked and laughed, dancing as if they were birds enjoying flight for the first time.‚Äù Chona runs the grocery store, and extends credit to anyone who can‚Äôt afford to pay; she rarely keeps a record of their debt. The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store may lose money, but it is rich in goodwill and kindness.Back to this being like a musical book‚Äîa jazzy book. Jazz music conjures that raspy, soulful, edgy flavor, blended from a mix of cultures and harmonies. McBride embraces those diverse, insistent, zingy, soul-stirring rhythms and blues into the narrative threads of his novel. I can hear the swing and the chase, the boogie and the blues, the sounds that go everywhere at once and jelly roll the story within a complex set of fusion and feelings. It‚Äôs also just a damned good story!The narrative pulls you here and there, up and down, and when you meet Dodo, the sweet and barely teenaged deaf kid, your protective instincts will wrap yourself around him and never want to let him go. And, when Dodo meets Monkey Pants‚Äîwell, this right there‚Äîthe heart of the novel that will break you in pieces.At times, I had a wellspring of tears‚Äînot just for joy or anguish. Sure, comedy and tragedy fill these pages. But McBride‚Äôs natural humanity and gentle nature is the colossal, phenomenal heart of the book. The author steps aside, he doesn‚Äôt ever intrude. The core of the narrative are the characters. Their cacophony becomes a coda for living large.This tale made me want to be better, to do better, to open my eyes to all the missed connections, to fix the broken chords and forge new ones, and seek eternally to strengthen them. We are humanity, we are the essential substance to add love to the world, one modest good deed at a time. That is The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.","5",""

Yes, the mystery of the skeleton hovers quietly over the story, but it‚Äôs largely in the background in a narrative about the difficult lives of a diverse group of small-town, lower-class folks trying to get by. Prejudice and discrimination mix with accommodation and friendship, suspicions and mistrust bump up against shared experience and the best of humanity. And the dialog ‚Äì oh the dialog! ‚ÄúSo he balled up his fist‚Ä¶and I mean that white boy reached back and sent that big fist of his rambling through four or five states before it said hello to Fatty. It started in Mississippi, gone up through the Carolinas, stopped for coffee in Virginia, picked up steam coming outta Maryland‚Ä¶and boom! He liked to part Fatty from this world.‚Äù Or this: ‚ÄúBernice had the kind of face that would make a man wire home for money.‚Äù And this: ‚Äú‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not technically illegal. But we gotta do it at night.‚ÄùUltimately this book is an invitation to appreciate the value of empathy and respect. It‚Äôs a powerful reminder that we‚Äôre all in this together. And yes ‚Äì it‚Äôs a delight to read.","5",""

Perez","4.0 out of 5 stars","Assured, Propulsive, Scathing writing","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024","In the neighborhood of Chicken Hill, Pottstown, Pennsylvania, in June 1972, police found a skeleton, wearing a gold chain with a mezuzah, at the bottom of a well, next to a lot that had been torn down a day earlier to make way for a new neighborhood. They visited the home of the only Jew left on Chicken Hill, on account of the mezuzah; his home stood on the site that almost half a century earlier had been the local synagogue. Because of this, he was deemed a suspect, though he would never face charges. He skipped town almost immediately, and days later the neighborhood was reduced to rubble by a devastating hurricane.Forty-seven years earlier, in 1925, young theater-manager Moshe Ludlow bet the little money he had saved on hiring a famous musical act to play at his small venue. Jews from all over the Northeast came to dance and frolic. Moshe recovered his investment many times over. He married Chona Yakov, the brilliant daughter of the local rabbi, and settled in Chicken Hill, which was then a vibrant community home to Blacks and Jews. As years went by, most affluent Jews moved downtown. Chona refused to move out. Moshe and Chona owned a two-story building that housed the neighborhood‚Äôs only store on the first floor, The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store, and their home on the second floor. The store was a losing business on account of Chona‚Äôs kindness, but it was a regular hangout spot and neighbors loved it.Over the next twelve years, Chicken Hill, and the world at large, undergo seismic changes‚Äîthe local KKK chapter gains popularity, Nazism rises in Europe, and America‚Äôs immigrants begin to question their new way of life. Among all these social changes, Chicken Hill‚Äôs inhabitants undergo personal upheavals as well, but their sense of community remains strong despite the adversities that come their way.The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store is a novel in three parts and an epilogue, told by an omniscient narrator, about the ups and downs of a community between the years 1925-1936, in an ever-changing world. It touches on several themes, such as racial politics, inequality, sexual violence, disability, sense of community and belonging, friendship, and karmic justice.The first thing that struck me as I settled into the story was McBride‚Äôs assured, propulsive, scathing writing. Despite being an ensemble kind of story, each individual character shines thoroughly, so the reader gets to know each character‚Äôs motivations, inner life, idiosyncrasies. I haven‚Äôt been that crazy about an ensemble cast of characters as I was with these. The curmudgeons in the story are some of the most sympathetic people in it.The Heaven‚Ä¶ is by no means a happy novel; there are weighty issues and sadness overload, but they are treated so compassionately and so beautifully that the reader will root for these underdogs.","4",""

It could have been written by a world reknown comedian plus history teacher, plus a person from the era's witness protection program, if they had one. Amusing, fast and unbelivable quick and witty dialogue; loveable characters strongly drawn. It is possible to have misty eyes on the last page. Don't miss this 5 star book.

"product4","top review","27","fizzleswim","4.0 out of 5 stars","Great for a Book Club","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","This is a well written book with a good story . The beginning chapters were rough. They didn't flow well as the cadence was off and therefore the story felt  like it stumbled along . It needed better descriptions of physical characteristics of  the people and places in the novel . It also desperately needed humor.  The book is grimly compelling. There are many profound and memorable moments in this book.1930's America was not the promised land of easy living for immigrants and it still isn't today.The book does a decent job of portraying life for people who are not male WASP in 1930's Pennsylvania.It takes place in a community on the outskirts of the main town. The people of the Hill, who are viewed as "" less than "" by  the mainstream WASP town people, are vibrant and hardworking people who are important to the town even if the town does not acknowledge that.The community on the Hill is diverse. Their are many different types of Jewish people, ""Disabled"" ,Blacks, Germans, Italian , and Latino people living there all tied together by Chona, Moshe, The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store and the Theater.Chona, ""Dodo"", and "" Monkey Pants "" are what keeps the story hopeful and compelling.The book does have the underlying message of ""White Privilege"" makes it almost impossible for anyone other than able bodied male WASP to arrive at their full potential and that  immigrants lives are hard. At times the reader feels like this is just a message on continuous repeat. Although on the surface the message of book is that is that if you are not  Male, White, Anglo Saxon Protestant like the original founders of the United States Constitution life is hard, it is really a book about community and how we can all make life better for one another if we stay united and work together.It's a good "" book club"" read but needs humor.","4",""
"product4","top review","28","Mr&Mrs","5.0 out of 5 stars","Character-Driven, Slice-of-Life Tale; the Ending Pushed It to a 5 for Me","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024","There are numerous characters in this book, and some of them are the strong ones who drive the story. One bit of advice I have is do not get bogged down trying to keep a list of who everybody is in this 385 (print edition) book because that will ruin the reading experience. Readers will not have any trouble remembering the major important characters of Chicken Hill, a rural area of immigrants - Blacks, Jews from various countries, and poor immigrant Whites. Chona is the polio-crippled daughter of a rabbi whom  Romanian-Jew Moshe finds attractive and full of humor, and it is Chona who runs the Heaven &Earth Grocery Store. Often, she extends credit so that her neighbors can eat, knowing that it is unlikely they can ever repay her in full.This is definitely a character-driven story; many pages are primarily dialogue. This is not a book that everyone will love because it might seem a bit slow in this day and age of thrillers. There are many flawed characters, but the difference between good guys and bad guys is whether a character exhibits any concern for others. (using ""guys"" as a generic human being, as in west coast people who say ""you guys"" meaning persons of any gender being spoken to).  I would say that this is a book about humanity, about the importance of talking to people of other cultures and religions, trying to understand, and- above all- learning to get along for the betterment of our planet.At the end of chapter 7, a 10-year-old Black boy named Dodo is introduced. For me, Dodo's experiences are what made the book a five star. i don't want to say any more, but it is powerful.","5",""

I found myself slowing down my reading in order to keep pace with all the characters introduced in the book.  Perhaps the author might have restructured his storyline so that there were not too many characters, principal and incidental, for the reader to track.  In the end though, the book left significant loose ends about what would have happened next in the lives of the principal characters.  Ultimately, I felt let down as a reader.  It seems that the author wanted to convey that as difficult and fraught life is, there is basic goodness and redemption that sprinkles the person at different points in his/her life.  While the book indeed dwelled on the characters' difficulties and fraught lives, the author (for me) failed to also narrate redemption in its proper context.  There was a summarized, indirect reference to some level of victory in the end, but its emotional impact was far too downplayed to a brief, hurried epilogue. The ending failed to make me smile, which I suspect is what the author would have hoped for his reader.  Because I felt that the author failed to explore (or narrate) what would have happened to the characters after the ""climax"", the book did not give me a sense of closure; the story felt like it was not on balance.  I could not say that this was one of the best books that I have read.  But by no means is this work uninteresting.","4",""
