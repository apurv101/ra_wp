In other words,not enough spoken dialogue .Oprah's book club missed the boat on this one.  I gave it two stars only because it shows how all families van love and hurt each other so deeply.",

This reminds me of a Colleen Hoover book.  A very easy read with a predictable plot. No thanks.  It's also hard to read a book where you don't like the main character. Actually, I couldn't connect with any of the characters but Julia was so especially unlikeable. Completely self absorbed and selfish. I expected more.",

Then, furious about the relationship one of her sisters (who is, unrealistically, practically beatified) develops with her ex once she's left town, she refuses to maintain contact or allow her daughter to have contact with any of them for more than 20 years.  Oddly -- and unsuccessfully -- the author attempts to portray this detestable character sympathetically.  It's readable, but ultimately unsatisfying.",

I only persisted in reading it to the end because it was what I brought on vacation. Did Oprah choose this because it is set in Chicago? I expect the theme of recovery from a severe mental health crisis played a part in her choosing it and that aspect of the book is the reason I am giving it two stars rather than the one it otherwise deserves.",

It took a lot of time to figure out which characters to love and which characters to eventually forgive.However I really struggled with the first 1/3-1/2 of the book. The set up dragged out a bit for me and I was wondering if I would ever finish this book! I just couldn\u2019t fall in love with the main characters and the descriptions of the characters\u2019 lives felt dreary and hard to read. I blazed through the second half surprisingly. If you can get past the first 1/3 I would say it\u2019s worth finishing! A good book for those who want to enter a family and the messiness of it all. It\u2019s filled with a slow drama feel to it through the lens of a handful of characters. I wouldn\u2019t directly parallel it to Little Women, which may have been why I felt led astray in the beginning to be honest.",

Telling the stories that make for a multi-generational, multi-perspective family saga, this book, at its core, looks at what defines a 'family\" - love - while looking at more modern subjects including generational trauma, suicide, prejudice and ignorance.

William Waters, lost and introverted, grew up in a wildly different household, where overwhelming grief over the loss of his sister took hold of his parents\u2019 lives, leaving him to fend for himself.When Julia meets William she is determined to become his wife and create the husband she\u2019s always dreamed of, making him a project of sorts. He isn\u2019t exactly sure where he fits into her plan or her family, and when tragedy strikes, the family\u2019s bond is stretched to its limits.While it is a contemporary take on the classic Little Women, it\u2019s absolutely its own magnificent story. It\u2019s a beautiful but heavy and emotional read as each character\u2019s story unfolds, and your heart aches as you find a place for each of them there.",

At the beginning of the book all she cared about was making sure her girls were strong, educated, self-sufficient women and then boom, suddenly decides she does not need them in her life and moves away.  The biggest disappointment of all though is the ridiculous \"powerful love story\" between William and Sylvie which you could see coming from a mile away although not for any reason that made sense.  He tries to kill himself, she decides at that moment she is in love, they have nothing in common and nothing about their dreary little lives feels big or important, it just seems like two sad people who found and clung onto each other.  And then of course we get the answer to the question I knew to expect from the beginning.  Which of these not very exciting characters will die to pull at our heart strings.  Eye roll.",

It\u2019s not even in the same stratosphere as that beloved book. While I like Little Women, I don\u2019t love it like my daughter-in-law does. After being disappointed, I passed my copy of Hello, Beautiful to her to see what I was missing. She agreed it was similar in that it was a family saga about four very close sisters and the young man who comes into their lives, but it should not be compared to Little Women. My daughter-in-law gave it only 2 stars out of 5. We both agreed that in a large part of the book, particularly the middle, readers spend too much time inside the minds of the characters. As another critic explained Napolitano needs to show us, not tell us. Because of this, the novel became repetitive and kind of a slog fest. The book is not horrible, but it\u2019s not the great book I expected.",

        "Date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023",
        "Body": "This is an incredibly thorough look into the minds and workings of a family of four sisters growing up in Chicago late -mid 20th century (prior to the tech boom).  I liked the writing style which  easily drew me into the character's psyches and I was quickly hooked on wanting to know what would happen to them.  The oldest sister is intent on mapping her future, like a scientist with laser- focused determination and wearing blinders. We learn about each character via chapters told from first-person perspective.This book is a deep character study of a family, with so little plotline beyond that of how they grow as they age and what happens to them as a result of their personal and conjoined perspectives that  I eventually grew weary of the narrow focus, so rich in character but lacking in the other elements that make a book interesting to me; action, setting, place.  As others have mentioned the middle of the book gets too bogged down in head-game thinking/telling.Half a star for NOT writing politics into the narrative as so many authors are prone to do today.  This reader/reviewer is begging them to please stop doing that.",

        "Body": "As a bibliophile, I've always appreciated Oprah's Book Club selections. I haven't wholly shared her taste in books, but I've always looked forward to seeing book recommendations from a smart, literate thought leader.Wow. Oprah and I surely weren't on the same page this time.\u200eAnn Napolitano is a highly skilled writer. Her words exude warmth and empathy, and her characters -- major and minor -- spring to life. I would have given her 5 stars for drawing me into the characters' inner lives and making me root for a more compelling plot, but I ended up hard-pressed to justify giving it 3 stars.Somehow, I just found this book difficult to wade through. I couldn't stay focused on the story. It wasn't the sudden onset of an attention span issue or cognition problem for me. Perhaps I was a bit distracted because of a huge breaking national news story--but, heck, we always have huge breaking national news stories, don't we? This just about never happens to me.But I failed to buy into the narrative. The characters were real, and there was character development, but it took too much time and provided almost no satisfaction by the time it happened. I forced myself to finish the book only because I felt that the payoff may have been worth it.It wasn't. For those who started to read the book, I want to warn you that there's no light at the end of the tunnel. For me, the time I invested in finishing this book would have been far better spent in joyfully reading other works. YMMV, of course.By the way, I loved \"Dear Edward,\" by the same author. So I'd probably read another book that she wrote. But, likely, I\"d borrow it from the library instead of purchasing it.",

        "Body": "HELLO BEAUTIFULAnn NapolitanoWhen I turned my eBook to page one, I said aloud \u201cHELLO, BEAUTIFUL!\u201dI knew from page one that I was in for a good time what I did not know was how much I\u2019d enjoy this book and the process of reading it and I certainly didn\u2019t know I had found a new favorite author.In Hello Beautiful we start with William. William was born to a family suffering a great loss. And even in the first few pages with William, we come to know him in all that he isn\u2019t instead of what he is. It\u2019s an interesting way to construct a character.In the next chapter, we meet Julia and all that she is and all that she has. She is a lot, has a lot. Specifically, things that William does not. She has a close, loving family, and she has a plan and the will to carry it out.William and Julia meet in college and begin a wonderful life together. We follow over the years as eventually, William's past comes to light and the very thing that drew them together threatens to tear them apart.I read this one towards the end of 2022 and had to hold onto this review for over six months. It was torture. It was one of the best books I read last year, and I can\u2019t wait for you to read it. It would make a great book club selection as there would be a lot to discuss. I imagine readers on opposing sides of imaginary lines, arguing their point. And they would both be right. That is the beauty of this book.Let\u2019s talk about what I especially liked about it.The first thing I loved and noticed was the sentence structure. There is a pattern to the structure that creates a rhythm that increases reading enjoyment. Essentially it is very easy to read.The second thing I loved is what I noted previously. I loved how William was constructed as a character. His pages felt vacuous. As if I were leaving a part of myself there with him on every page. There is a scene early on when William is describing a moment with a professor. That passage is so telling of William and his lens for seeing his world and interacting with it.The third thing I loved was the number of emotions that were stirred within me. I don\u2019t remember the last time I was angry with a fictional character. It\u2019s been six months and I still disagree with some of the characters' choices.Although this was a five-star read for me I do want to note how critical the writing is. These characters are beautifully imperfect, and the narrative, no matter the character, was severe in correction. This can lead to a lack of empathy toward the characters and their situation. It didn\u2019t affect me much, but I think readers should be aware of that going in.HELLO BEAUTIFUL comes out on March 14, 2023, and I highly recommend it.Now an Oprah Book Club pick for March 2023HELLO BEAUTIFUL\u2026\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThanks to Random House Publishing Group - Random House, The Dial Press for the advanced copy!",

The depth of the family connection plays such a part in who they are and the author explains this in a comprehensive way, making the story come full circle.

I can understand why she literally had to write the dates at the beginning of every chapter because the setting didn\u2019t in any way reflect the time period.In 1997, Alice and her friend were singing along to records? Really? They didn\u2019t have CDs? Was the author alive in 1997?When Alice is in college in the early 2000s and searches for her aunt\u2019s artwork, the author doesn\u2019t even mention the internet. I understand not dwelling on it, but surely there are relevant implications about the ease of uncovering secrets in a world that is suddenly so much more connected than it has ever been before.Ultimately I gave up after the Alice chapter that ends in 2003. You mean to tell me in 2001, Alice is in Boston, and her mother is in New York, and the author was in no way compelled to even mention 9/11? At all? Wouldn\u2019t that have been a very real driver for the sisters to contact Julia to maybe, I don\u2019t know, find out if she was even alive? Or did they just shrug and sit around hoping for another postcard?The next chapter skips to 2008, and I don\u2019t see any point in continuing. Maybe this book is set in an alternate reality version of the 1980s-2000s that never evolved beyond the 1950s, but I can\u2019t suspend my disbelief enough to make this book believable.Oprah failed me this time.",

        "Body": "I bought hardcover & Kindle editions on day of release after seeing Oprah rave about it on CBS. What I appreciate most with Oprah's fiction picks is the selections tend to be a cut above (i.e. more literature) than morning show or other celeb book clubs. (I esp enjoyed Oprah's early picks back in late 90s.) I'm sad to report this was a big miss for me. Having been raised with 4 sisters in blue-collar Chicago, I thought it'd be a slam dunk, but I went from being underwhelmed to disappointed to annoyed. Pains me to write a mediocre review as author likely poured her heart and soul into it, but imo this book needed another year editing and revising, as this just wasn't there yet. A few specifics:* I applaud author for attempting to give characters depth & complexity but she violated basic rule of show, don't tell. Too much of the characters' personalities were explained with excess exposition but not SHOWN to readers through actions or dialogue.* While I don't adhere that authors should write only what they know, it was obvious to me early on the author didn't grow up with sisters, nor grow up or spend years in Pilsen or blue-collar Chicago. Neither felt authentic. Felt more as if author was on outside observing or imagining versus having lived it. I can overlook some tells, but the more those slips/omissions/errors add up, the more a reader loses faith in the entire story.*William's upbringing also didn't ring true. I can understand grief-stricken parents emotionally absent in a child's life, but not to the degree explained (not shown) in the book. More development and examples were needed, as parents cannot simply ignore a child--they still need to nurse, feed, cloth and shelter, etc. It's easy to tell but author needed to again SHOW us how cold parents can be there, but not present.* On plus side, the story & writing comes most alive to me with passages on basketball--the relationships, the tempo, the love of the game, the history. Here's where the author did her homework and really did a nice job translating it, esp to female readership (not to sound sexist, as I'm a woman who played basketball in her youth but still learned a few things or two and appreciated the insights she brought.)I'll leave it there as I don't mean to tear down a book that's not horrible, just not great. Possibly my disappointment is greater than most because I came up with high expectations and this just wasn't credible for me. As other reviewers noted, it's not a bad beach read, but not literature and not Oprah-caliber.  (Sorry for any typos--please don't review my review lol.)",

        "Body": "Hello Beautiful by Ann NapolitanoHello Beautiful centers around the Padavano sisters, and a man named William. Like the classic Little Women, we are intertwined into the sisters\u2019 close-knit family, and we bear witness to their life\u2019s highlights, but more so their downfalls. Oddly, as close as the sisters are displayed to the reader, we see very little in the way of communication between the four of them.There are marriages, births, loves and losses stretched across thirty-some-odd years. There is a beautifully storied first half, engulfing the reader. The middle of our story is lackluster though and a bit drawn out and I found myself uninterested.The last quarter of the book felt rushed to me like the author knew she had to wrap up the story. One character, in particular, I didn\u2019t understand at all. She\u2019s in her early 20s but does not have the inquisitive nature of an early twenty-something. This leads to my disappointment with this character. We have a very unfinished reunion at the very end, and unless there is going to be a sequel, leaves a lot of questions.I know this book is beloved by so many, and I did enjoy it, don\u2019t get me wrong. I think it was hyped so much that I expected to give it a perfect five-star rating. I\u2019m going to give Hello Beautiful three out of five stars. It was good, but had the potential to be great.",

I really wanted to like Hello Beautiful, but it was just too unbelievable.  There were hardly any likable characters, with the possible exception of William's basketball friends  It reads more like a soap opera than serious fiction.  For example, in what world other than soap opera can a widow who lives in a blue collar area and whose husband is described as having low paying jobs suddenly be able to move to Miami and hobnob with the wealthy?  How does she support herself?  We aren't told anything other than that she has wealthy friends.  In what world can a recent college graduate with a new baby be able to move to Manhattan (much less the upper east side) and afford childcare , housing, and expensive  clothes while doing research for a college professor?  Huh?  Sounds like fantasy.  And anyone who thinks Hello, Beautiful resembles Little Women obviously hasn't read the book.  The only similarity is that both books are about four sisters.  Can anyone imagine Marmie abandoning her children or not speaking to one of her daughters and granddaughters?  Really?  I had to force myself to finish this book.  As others have said, it was  depressing, peopled with unloving , unloveable , and unbelievable characters.",

She strongly believes her husband, Charlie, just doesn\u2019t quite measure up to what he could have been. Together, they have four daughters. Readers are drawn right into this story and feel every emotion the characters experience. Julie, the eldest of the four sisters, is a planner, a fixer, a girl who knows what she wants and knows how to get it. She has a plan for her life and it doesn\u2019t include living in a tiny house like where she was raised. Second daughter is quiet Sylvie, a reader who has worked in the public library since she was thirteen and sneaks kisses from the boys behind the shelves knowing she doesn\u2019t want a boyfriend. She doesn\u2019t  take the boys seriously because she is just practicing for her one true love. The twins who are energetic, fun loving girls, round out the Padavano sisters. Then there is William a loner, ignored and never loved at home, socially awkward, always wondering where he fits in, how should he behave, and why he wasn\u2019t enough for his parents. He only feels at home on the basketball court. Julie has decided William is just what she needs to get her life plan started. In alternating chapters, the four main characters tell their story with each chapter bearing the character\u2019s name. Quoting Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry and making comparisons of the four sisters to the sisters in Little Women by Alcott, this book is more than a family saga. This book is a love story. It is about acceptance, heartbreak, forgiveness, and understanding.  Napolitano\u2019s writing is thoughtful and beautiful. The story is deeply moving as each character grows and discover his or her truth and learns how powerful it is to live an authentic life. A five star read and on my list of favorite books in 2024!",

I'm quite sad that I've just finished it, because I don't want to say goodbye to William and the close knit family of four sisters he married into.  My own spare childhood resembles William's.  Yet this novel is a way of seeing what it might be like to be raised in an exuberant, complicated, loving family... and how it evolves over time, as each girl becomes her own self... and William comes to realize that he matters.What impresses me most about the writing of Ann Napolitano is her ability to go to the heart of the matter.  She allows us to see the inner lives of her characters, their aspirations, self-doubts, determination, losses and joys.  There is grace here... saving grace.Perhaps I'm particulary drawn to a work like this because, as child psychologist, I've spent years studying how childhood experiences influence who we become, and the healing that is sometimes needed when those experiences have been less than ideal.  Napolitano shows here how it's often the people closest to us, who care about us, who facilitate our healing.  What the author has created here feels firmly based in reality and the challenges human beings face, and, thankfully, she draws these characters to unexpected reconciliation.",

But they are mistaken.His girl tells him they will marry. She tells him he will be a professor. He starts to study. She tells him it's time for a baby. By the time the baby becomes her focus, he realizes he loves her favorite sister. He doesn't want to teach. He wants to work with the basketball team, the only people who ever truly saw him, and cared about him. And because he never knew parental love, he is afraid to be a parent.Read one of the best family stories I've ever enjoyed in Hello Beautiful. See how deftly the author draws her characters and allows you to see them by their actions from several points of view so that you learn their emotions and motivations layer by layer. By the end, you understand and forgive.Forgiveness\u2014and the lack thereof\u2014 is big in this novel. Having been banished by my mother from my family for several years, I was drawn deeply to the mother who stubbornly kept alive her anger against one of her children for so much longer than mine did. The same woman never forgave her husband for not being the man she expected him to be. She never understood that he was so much more.If you had a family, you understand that families\u2014even loving families\u2014are complicated. Families with problems are even more so. Each person adds his or her own characteristics, talents, opinions, and prejudices to a simmering pot of emotions, misunderstandings, and love. With every stir, the recipe can either boil over or settle into what it was meant to be. It's maybe how we get Forrest's box of chocolates\u2014you never know what you're gonna get.Read Hello Beautiful and see that what you thought, or what you were told, or what you expected of someone, is not necessarily the way the story all will turn out. Life is always a surprise at every turn. Why would we expect a book to turn out the way we wish it would? The curveball element makes life\u2014and books\u2014all the more worthwhile.",

But the book is told from four peoples perspectives, and the writer repeats things that they just told you from another person\u2018s perspective. And not only that things that could\u2019ve been a paragraph for four pages long.  This book is 400 pages it probably could have been 300 pages. Also, there are things that were just not believable. William\u2018s little sister dies after having a cough for six days? (Not a spoiler this happens in the first two pages.) The parents never speak of her again but they apparently watch home movies of her.  The mother/grandmother is mad and not speaking to one daughter for years but then proceeds to brag about her to the granddaughter? It was so long and boring.",

        "Body": "Do some reviewers see the name \"oprah\" and automatically become entralled?  When I started this book, I was in love with it.  After a period of \"beach reads\", this was refreshing.  The characters seemed well-drawn, and the writing was good.  As the book progressed, the characters no longer made sense.  I don't want to say too much and give away the plot.  Let's just say that the author would add new character traits whose only purpose seemed to be that she needed to make the book longer- and boy, did the book seem looong! These traits were not consistent with the character nor did they add complexity.  The motivations of the characters made no sense to me.  The book became so boring and bogged down in the characters' nonsensical thoughts and feelings, that I considered giving it up,,,but hey...after all, it IS an OPRAH book.  There had to be more to it. Right?  It must be one whopper of an ending...but no.  It wasn't.  It just wasn't a good book.",

        "Body": "I really wanted to like Ann Neapolitan\u2019s book, Hello Beautiful. My thirty- something daughters loved it. I, however, found the story of the sisters, their mother and William, the boyfriend/ husband to be very off putting. The sisters seem to be in such lock-step that I found their relationships to be unhealthy. Not beautiful at all. They are mothered by a woman who when widowed shuts one daughter and granddaughter completely out of her life for decades, and without a thought has little contact with the other three. William wanders around in a daze and constantly needs rescuing by 1. The sisters 2. Julia. 3. Sylvie and 4. Alice, the daughter he gave up without much thought as an infant. When tragedy occurs all of the characters gallop back to Pilsen ( a real Chicago suburb!) and without much discussion forgive one another\u2019s rather grave transgressions.This story simply doesn\u2019t touch the hearts and minds of the struggles it takes to be a fully formed forgiving, compassionate, yet sometimes failure of a family.Another Oprah miss.",

I love a good read, authors like Isabelle Allende and Barbara Kingsolver consistently meet my expectations. We trust those reviews and believe others' perceptions but perhaps we should question the procedure to determine that a book is worthy of being reviewed with 5 stars, or because Oprah or Reese loved it!  This book seemed to just drift along, with shallow characters, and no surprising plot twists or page-turners. I finished it last night and it left me so dissatisfied and wary about choosing \"Best Sellers\".  I discussed it yesterday at my book club and it will be interesting to see if any of the other readers concur. I usually do research on a book and author before ordering...this time I didn't.",

        "Body": "I'm going to have to disagree with the thrust of the reviews here for Hello Beautiful. I had to power through it. The author appears unable to introduce either wit or subtlety to the characters, with the possible exception of Rose, who is as thorny as her name suggests, and who is the one character through whose eyes I would have liked to have seen parts of the book told. Though disagreeable, Rose at least had some perspective on her children. Alas it was not to be. And then there's the author's need to explain, over and over, her characters' motivations rather than trust that her writing could show the reader. Not a few words could have been saved by letting the characters' actions do the explaining. In the end there's little for the reader to do but power through because the author has trusted us with no other role.",

        "Body": "Hello Beautiful by Ann Napolitano, an Oprah's Book Club selection was read by this reviewer as part of a challenge. It would not have been my choice otherwise. As a rule I read to escape and find that many of contemporary bestsellers require me to be too much in the now and too much in my head. So it was no surprise that I struggled to get into this novel. It was too achingly real! The characters, their lives, their dreams and their struggles collided with my own and made me want to withdraw into my own darkness. I so wanted to send this book to the trash bin. Though, as a writer I challenged myself to read other writers ,especially those that are bestsellers. I needed to discover what makes other authors so appealing. How do other writers set-up their stories, build their settings, develop their characters. After a break, I came back to Hello Beautiful and read this as a writer as well as a reader.  By applying a critiquing approach, I was able to achieve a degree of separation from the story. It was just enough to allow me to focus on the cadence of Ann Napolitano's words, to savor the style of her storytelling and to not get caught in my own angst and issues.I began to see how Hello Beautiful shared so many elements with one of my all time favorite books , Little Women. I was intrigued by the depth of personality of each of the sisters Ann Napolitano created. Ann was able to show how each sister was a part of the others yet completely individuals. How they became who they were was beautifully and intricately choreographed by Ann Napolitano throughout the novel. And, adding William a lost soul, an outsider to the mix, was a brilliant catalyst  for  the sisters growth and development!This was NOT an easy book to read. I  took several breaks but always came back.  This poignant story about family love and relationships, did end up stirring my heart and soul in ways, I admit, prefer to avoid.  At times, I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster.  By the time I reached the climax of the story I was fully invested in the characters and their lives, the many highs and lows they experienced and yet were able to weather because they had each other. I don't know how many other of Ann Napolitano's my tortured soul will be able to tolerate. I can say that the beauty of Ann Napolitano carefully crafted words, the images she brought to my mind's eye and the powerful feelings of love that seemed to leap from the pages of Hello Beautiful, eventually brought me to place of peace. I read the last page with a sigh. Then I closed my eyes and reflected on all my best memories of life in a large, obnoxiously in your face , flawed, loving family! All the highs and lows, the good times, the bad and the big loving mess of it all!SIGH.",
